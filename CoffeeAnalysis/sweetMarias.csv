Gahahe was built in the mid 1980s, a time when the World Bank was investing heavily in Burundi's coffee sector, building out washing stations like this one to serve the surrounding coffee communities, outfitted with a eco-pulping Penagos for processing coffee cherry. More recently they've come under the direction of a Burundi coffee investment group who are able to offer this coffee, as well as a few others we've purchased (Yandaro, and Kibingo to name a couple), agronomical assistance to station members, regular maintenance of washing station equipment and drying beds, and management teams who follow the coffee deliveries from cherry selection, to keeping lots separated by quality tiers.

The western highlands of Cameroon, where much of the coffee is grown, averages about 5,000 feet above sea level and has two distinct seasons, the rainy season and dry season, which benefits quality arabica. This lot is from the Grassfields Cooperative, located in the Bamenda Plateau region. However, this lot is from small holder farms in Kouoptamo, not too far from the mountainous Bamboutos region. The cooperative produces both wet and dry process coffees, and this is the former. They depulp coffee into tanks where it ferments for up to 36 hours to break down the sticky fruit mucilage, which can then be washed away with clean water.

In 2007, the farm was purchased as a joint venture by local Tanzanian coffee farmers, Leon and Aideen Christianakis, and a coffee roaster in Portland, Mark Stell. Since taking ownership, the group has focused on improving the quality through farm renovation, new plantings, soil analysis, and refining the post harvest processes. This is a dry process coffee, which means the seeds are dried with the cherry still intact. This can lead to fruity flavors in the cup, and characteristics like body, and low levels of acidity.

This lot is a dry process coffee, where the whole cherry is laid to dry on raised beds and not removed until both fruit and seed (green ""bean"") are down to 10-11% moisture. We've found that adding fruitier naturals to the equation helps lock in some of what we think of as Ethiopian origin characteristics, which is what we've done here. Wolenso Dabessa was acquired as part of a land grant by the government in 2008, where large areas of semi-forested area were given to farmers with the idea that planting coffee while preserving the natural forest canopy would be an improvement toward sustainability. While this is where Dabessa got his start, his father's history growing coffee in the region dates back to 1946. Dabessa's washing station happens to be on the site of his original farm. The farm and mill sit at around 1800 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown up to 2000. Check out the video tour we put together of Wolenso Dabessa HERE.

Farms in these regions tend to span an altitude range from about 1300 to 1600 meters and are planted in older, long berry types (you'll see the long, canoe shaped beans) Abysinnia, Ateng and Tim Tim. In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs. This coffee is an anaerobic-wet hulled coffee, a hybrid of sorts that constructs incredibly complex cup flavors. The first step of this hybrid coffee process involves storing the whole cherry in a sealed environment, which is where the name ""anaerobic"" comes from (though not entirely correct, since there is still oxygen inside the barrels or bags used). While the cherry is fermenting in this closed system, the CO2 that is created during the process builds into a high pressure environment, that supposedly allows for a more controlled fermentation process. One thing's for sure, most of the anaerobic fermented coffees we've tried skew toward outlier fruit flavors, winey in character, and with lower acidity. This seems to be the case here, though tempered by the wet hulled/giling basah step that follows. The cherry and fruit are peeled straight from the fermentation tanks, and then dried the rest of the way on raised beds. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region. But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds.

Many of the farms in this area are planted in older Typica types and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level. This is a wet hulled coffee, also known as ""giling basah"". This is the typical process method in Sumatra and involves removing the parchment layer while the coffee is still wet, exposing it to the elements well before the coffee is stable. When handled well during the drying phase (like this coffee), this rustic process method yields an earth-toned, bodied cup, with mild acidity and syrupy sweetness, and the green bean taking on a dark green hue unlike wet or dry process coffees from other producing countries. Having roasted this coffee, I'm very pleased with the uniformity of roast color and the minimal quakers from underripe coffee making it through. Giling basah - and Sumatran coffee in general - has a reputation for being riddled with defects even at ""Grade 1"" standard.

This lot is a pulp natural process which is about as closed to a fully washed coffee as you will get in Brazil, and quite similar to a mild honey process method in Costa Rica. The coffee cherry and much of the fruit are removed with depulping machinery, and then the seed is laid to dry with fruit mucilage still intact. Pulp naturals often possess more balanced flavors than dry process coffee, less fruited, and can still be big-bodied and lower acid coffees, making them a great choice for espresso and blending.",-22.235768,-45.578938,8.0,8.3,0,8.3,8.7,8.0,8.2,8.5,8.0,8.5,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.5

In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate (""EA""). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname ""sugar cane decaf"", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment.

Working under the codename of the ""Donkey Blend"" (don't ask how all these ridiculous names started ---I think it was George's fault) we came up with this. It is intended to be used several ways. As an all-decaf espresso blend I wanted it to work well under a wide variety of roasting conditions, in terms of both lighter Northern Italian type espresso roasts (the equivalent of a Full City to Vienna Roast) and the darker Southern Italian type roast (roasted to a French roast). I also wanted a good espresso from both air and drum roasters, and I wanted good crema. This is a lot to ask from a decaf, but I think this blend works very well. While origin tastes are muted in decafs, I think the bittersweet roast tastes from this blend are very good.

The specific blend, hey ... it is my secret! But I will tell you that the 5 coffees that really worked toward the flavor goal I imagined ended up surprising even me! We've refined the recipe over the year, and at the moment, there's a washed Central, wet-hulled Indonesia, a monsooned coffee, and even a modicum of quality Robusta. And to keep this a mystery, the blend contains some coffees not on our list. I admit this is a pretty wacky blend by the current fashion in espresso toward lighter-roasted and acidic coffees; it's downright dated really. But it works in its own way. Some emphasis here is on the physical character of the espresso, hence the use of the monsooned coffee, which has properties in terms of crema that no other coffee possesses.

It's great as espresso in the Full City+ to Vienna roast territory, and the mix of dry process coffees handle well in the roaster, regardless of the difference in density when sticking to the recommended roast range. Full City roasts may show some variance, and I recommend taking your roasts closer to Full City+ development which will help afford roast evenness. Slowly ramping up the heat will also help in this effort if your roaster has manual heat control. For those without (like a popper for example), try slowing your roast by slightly overloading the chamber and I wouldn't stop the roast development until you're on the heels of 2nd snaps. (I ""overload"" the roast chamber by first turning the popper on, then adding coffee until just after it stops moving - it should only take a few seconds to get the coffee moving again).

It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our ""dumping ground"" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions.

What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema?
