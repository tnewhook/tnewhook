       "      <td>Gahahe Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Gahehe sits at just over 1800 meters above sea level and is a collection site for roughly 600 local farmers who are also coop members. As members, they are organized into small groups who receive training in best agricultural practices, seedlings to continue to help increase coffee production, and benefit from access to the global specialty coffee market. Gahahe was built in the mid 1980s, a time when the World Bank was investing heavily in Burundi's coffee sector, building out washing stations like this one to serve the surrounding coffee communities, outfitted with a eco-pulping Penagos for processing coffee cherry. More recently they've come under the direction of a Burundi coffee investment group who are able to offer this coffee, as well as a few others we've purchased (Yandaro, and Kibingo to name a couple), agronomical assistance to station members, regular maintenance of washing station equipment and drying beds, and management teams who follow the coffee deliveries from cherry selection, to keeping lots separated by quality tiers. Since partnering with this group, several of the stations have seen top placement in Burundi coffee competitions, including Gahahe placing 4th in the 2015 Burundi CoE, and 7th the year prior.</td>\n",

With the fruit intact, dry times increase 3 to 4 fold, taking upwards to a month depending on weather. Dry process coffees tend to be fruit-forward, sometimes even \"winey\" in a slightly fermented flavor, bodied and acidity flattened to some degree. What we have here with Kibingo is a clean example of dry process coffee with a lot of fruit character, never quite reaching the \"ferment\" flavors. Kibingo Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the 18 hills that surround Kibingo. Kibingo sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Kibingo is named after reeds that are growing in the river running alongside the station site, planted in order to help keep the soil at the banks from eroding. They've been around since the mid 1980s, and a couple years back, took 1st place at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small feat.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Murambi is an impressive operation, a privately owned collection site in the Kiganda area near the Mubarazi river. The coffee processed at Murambi are from the surrounding hillside villages (\"collines\"), which there's talk of separating in the future, but this year was all blended together by day of delivery. Most of the farms are around 2000 meters above sea level and entirely planted in Bourbon. They mostly produce fully washed coffee using the traditional Kenyan method, but this is a dry process batch, often referred to as \"natural\". Dry processing involves leaving the cherry intact during the entire drying stage, which extends the time it takes to sufficiently dry the coffee to anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. This tends to dim high notes/acidity, as well as impart fruited flavor notes on the cup profile, which can certainly be said about this lot. A few years back the station received a cash premium at the year's end for the coffees they exported, and the mill owner invested in 450 goats that were distributed to as many farmers who work with the station. The program is for the goats to both help with building out an organic farming system, as well as an added source of revenue for the farmers and is still in place today. It is also worth a mention that Murambi won the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition in 2012.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cameroon is an interesting origin in the Specialty Coffee terms. For starters, this is West African coffee, not East African like most other arabica offerings such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Rwanda. And a large percentage of Cameroon coffee has traditionally been robusta, grown in all provinces except the north, while arabica is mainly produced in the high altitudes of the west, northwest and east. The western highlands of Cameroon, where much of the coffee is grown, averages about 5,000 feet above sea level and has two distinct seasons, the rainy season and dry season, which benefits quality arabica. This lot is from the Grassfields Cooperative, located in the Bamenda Plateau region. However, this lot is from small holder farms in Kouoptamo, not too far from the mountainous Bamboutos region. The cooperative produces both wet and dry process coffees, and this is the former. They depulp coffee into tanks where it ferments for up to 36 hours to break down the sticky fruit mucilage, which can then be washed away with clean water. Coffee is dried on raised beds for around a week to 10 days. Most of the coffee is grown around 1000 to 1200 meters, and you see a lot of Java and Jamaica varieties planted in Cameroon. I want to mention that found a few lentils/seeds in the 132# jute bag we just opened. It's not all that uncommon in coffee since they often share the same drying patio. Some mills are better than others at getting it out, but it does come with the territory. We removed what we spotted by hand, but expect that one or two may make it through our own screening every now and then. Just give the green beans a scan before roasting. They stand out, and are easy to spot!</td>\n",

First, the coffee cherry is floated in water to remove any underripe coffee, which typically floats to the top, while the ripe coffee sinks. Once the coffee is moved to the drying tables it undergoes several more rounds of hand sorting. All of this attention lends to a fairly uniform coffee, especially when you consider it is dry process.

Their father worked for the local union many years ago as a coffee collector, going out into the surrounding towns buying coffee cherries from farmers. The processing site sits at 2200 meters above sea level, and some of the farms they buy from are even higher elevation! They produce both dry and wet process coffees. Dry process coffees typically dry in sun for 3 days, and then an addition 2+ weeks in the shade. We found the cup expressed relatively clean stone fruit flavors, and reminded me of some of the coffees we buy from cooperatives in the West.

The station is Buno Buliye Buliye, and sits at a very high altitude of 2195 meters above sea level. They are process around 1.5 containers of dry process coffee, which believe it or not, is on the small side. It also means these 120 bags are roughly 1/3 of their output last year. These lots are made up of coffee from several hundred different farmers, most with only a couple hundred coffee trees or less. You tend to see coffee intercropped with other fruits and vegetables, \"false banana\" being one the more common food staples to see planted in the Hambela region. Dry processing is the oldest coffee processing method still used, and involves drying the coffee bean and cherry whole. From pictures you see, you might think you can just dump the cherries to the beds and wait. This is not the case, and the best lots take a lot of preparation! The coffee has to be spread out to a layer depth of only a few centimeters, no more, in order to allow air flow. The coffee is turned hourly, or even more frequently, in order to facilitate even drying and keep the coffee from molding. It's not difficult, but requires constant attention. Workers continually pull out lower quality coffee in the form of physical defects and coffee that was not harvested at peak ripeness in order to cultivate Grade 1 quality.</td>\n",

This lot looks to be as small as 14 screen (measured as 14/64\"), though I did not have any issues with beans finding their way through my Behmor grid drum. They produce both dry and wet process coffees. The dry process method involves drying the whole coffee cherry in the sun, fruit and all. When done with care, it can be complex, fruited, and even aromatic like their washed counterparts. Special attention is given to removing coffee that is not uniformly ripe in order to create their Grade 1 lots. It requires a lot of hand labor, and helps with uniformity in the cup. The coffee dries for 2-3 weeks on raised beds, then stored in a cool warehouse where it rests for at least a month before being prepared for export. The Harsu Wokilo mill is run by Gemechu Shonora, along with brothers Shebura, Morkata and Adugna.

       "      <td>Hambela Dabaye is from longtime Guji coffee farmer and mill manager, Kedir Hassan. He is the older brother to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. \"Dabaye\" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to be hosted at this station on our December 2018 visit, camping out in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is an incredibly proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and with efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamena, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.</td>\n",

This region happens to produce some of the most incredible white honey we've tasted in Ethiopia, so the name is particularly fitting! The Kenisa station has registered 305 members since starting up 2 years ago. Initially, they set out on their own but lacked access to getting their coffee to the international market. The Agaro Union is well situated in this respect and is connecting them to a much wider network of buyers (lucky us!). We visited the site last January and the cleanliness and organization were impressive. They employ a water conserving Penagos 2500 to depulp the coffee and the machine looks brand new. We found the coffee from Kenisa to have a stone fruit flavor characteristic common to coffee from this region. Light roasts are delicious and the most vibrant cups. I noticed quite a few latent 'snaps' at the end of 1st crack making degree of roast a bit difficult to judge by sound alone. If you are shooting for a light roast, I would err on the side of caution and pull the roast 1:20 or so after 1st C begins and adjust from there.</td>\n",

Along with coffee from their own farm called \"Daye Bensa\", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby - Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. The samples we tasted from all three sites scored very high and we wound up buying wet and dry process lots from most of them. This lot is a mix of coffees harvested from their own farm and out growers around Bombe village. Ethiopian heirloom cultivars are the main seeds cultivated and altitude ranges from just under 2000 meters to 2100 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that the screen size is on the small side too. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting a few 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay. Behmor users might give their drums a shake after loading the green coffee to allow the tiny beans to fall through before roasting.</td>\n",

In most cases, this involves depulping the fruit, followed by a fermentation stage that washes away any remaining fruit mucilage, and then drying the coffee on raised beds. At Gikirima, the fruit is removed using a disc-type depulper, common to Kenya. The fermentation stage is typical held to 24 hours, and dry times range from 1 to 2 weeks depending on weather. The washing station sits on the south side of Mount Kenya at 1800 meters above sea level, and farms can reach up to 2000 meters. \"AB\" refers to the size of the coffee bean, in this case 15/64\" to 17/64\". These are the medium sized beans, only trumped by the slightly larger \"AA\". In terms of cup quality, there's not always a discernible difference.

       "      <td>Nguguini is a green coffee \"Factory\" located in the Kirinyaga district, just across the border from Nyeri. Factories are basically what we call a wet mill, or washing station, a local station where farmers bring coffee cherry fruit for processing in Kenya. These Factories are cooperatives made up by local coffee farmers in the surrounding villages, most of which have tiny plots of coffee, less than 1 hectare in size. Ngugu-ini was established in 1958 as part of the Kibirigwi Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"), an umbrella of eight Kirinyaga coops in total, serving more than 7,000 coffee farmers (Ngugu-ini has 1,200 members). The wet mill stands at 1650 meters above sea level, which is a good estimation of median altitude for the farms delivering here. AA, AB and Peaberry separations are made from a single day's harvest, and are merely separations of different bean size range. AA are the largest, and command the highest premiums, but we're never really sure which will shine brightest. In the case of this coffee, we didn't get to taste the AB and Peaberry separations, but were floored by the vibrance and complex matrix of flavor found in this AA.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chinga is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, dating back to the late 1950s. Chinga Factory was the second mill to be developed under Othaya umbrella in 1960. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we were well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years. Chinga Peaberry was purchased direct, not through the Kenya auction system, so we could avoid the risk of losing it. To do this we pay a price that is higher than what the top auction bid might be, but it means we get the exact lot we want. This is a \"peaberry\" outturn, which occur when one of the two embryos that typically grown inside a coffee cherry fails to germinate, leaving only one seed to develop and grow into a small, rounded coffee bean. Peaberries can taste a little different than their flat bean counterparts, though not always the case. We picked up the large AA, and medium AB sizes, as well as this single 16 bag lot of peaberries from Chinga Factory.</td>\n",

This is the first year we've tasted there coffee, and feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to pick up this stellar AB lot! Igutha currently has around 600 members delivering their coffee cherry to the mill, and farms are typically 1 hectare or less, and at an altitude range of 1700 - 1900 meters. After depulping the coffee, they employ up to 48 hour fermentation time to beak down the sticky fruit mucilage surrounding the seeds. The coffee is then moved to raised drying beds where it will dry for 2-3 weeks. The preferred cultivars are SL-28, and SL-34 bourbon selections, known for good cup quality, especially when growing conditions are favorable.

A \"factory\" is a wet mill where the coop members bring coffee cherry for pulping, fermenting, washing, drying. It's not the factory as we might imagine it. Small washing stations are aligned with a particular \"society\" which is what they call a \"Farmers Cooperative Society\" in Kenya, or simply \"FCS\". This coffee comes from Njuriga Factory, which happens to also be the name of the FCS umbrella. They currently have just under 500 members, most of which are growing coffee on less than 1 hectare of land. Farms in this region tart around 1750 meters above sea level, and tend to be planted in SL-28, SL-34, and Ruiru-11 coffee varieties. We don't want to risk coffees losing a coffee like this in the Kenyan auction system, so we typically pay a premium to ensure the final cost is at or above what the auction price might be in order to secure it. This is the AB outturn, which means the size of the green coffee seeds will fall between a range of 15/64\" and 17/64\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rukira is a wet mill, what is referred to as a \"factory\" in Kenya terms. Basically this is where members bring coffee cherry for processing - pulping, fermenting, washing, and drying. It's a cooperative setup where these different stations are aligned with farmer members, and the stations belong to a much larger cooperative society: in this case Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"). Rukira is one of several member stations, and is comprised of over 500 members delivering coffee cherry to the mill. The Othaya FCS started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Altitude of the washing station is just shy of 1900 meters, and you mostly see SL-28 and SL-34, along with a little Ruiru and Batian cultivars mixed in. Several years back we bought an AB auction lot of Rukira, and we're glad to see it's return. Fruited, bright, sweet, juicy - a real stunner Kenya. This was bought as part of Othaya's own program they call \"Red Cherry\". In short, they pick a few of the farmers who consistently deliver top quality coffee and then work with them to employ an added layer of cherry sorting before the coffee is depulped. This way, they are able to pick out any coffee that is visibly outside the color spectrum that would indicate peak ripeness (hence the name, \"Red Cherry\"!). We generally buy three different outturns from Kenya that are differentiated by bean size; the large AA beans, the medium size AB beans, which this is, and the rounded \"peaberries\". To be clear, all of these different grades are separated from a single lot of coffee, and there's no clear tie to cup quality. Overall, I found this coffee to roast evenly, color quite uniform as you pass a City roast level.</td>\n",

We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. The coffees from Othaya Factories have been on our radar for a long time and we've had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years. The coffee from Thuti is grown between 1800 and 1900 meters above sea level, and the station serves hundreds of farmer members in the area. The preferred cultivars are SL-28, and SL-34 bourbon selections, known for good cup quality, especially when growing conditions are favorable.

Factories generally supply more than just access to the coffee market, and Karatu offers additional programs including access to capital for farm reinvestment, and provides members with agronomical inputs. The Karatu site sits at around 1890 meters above sea level, and is strategically situated next to the Rwabura river where it is able to pump clean water for processing coffee. They've dug waste water pits where the water used for processing is directed, and soaks into the soil, instead of running off back into the river. This is one of two lots of Karatu we purchased this year, and an AB selection, which refers to the size of the beans (15/64\" to 17/64\").

This is a dry process lot (also referred to as, \"natural\"), where the whole coffee cherry is laid to dry on raised beds until the green seed within reaches a moisture level of around 11%. That tends to take around 30 days. In that time, the cherries ferment, and often impart fruit flavors in the cup. This coffee was fruited in both light and dark roasts, even winey. It also produced a fair amount of chaff when roasting which is something to keep in mind if roasting on a machine with exposed heating elements like the Behmor, or running back to back batches.</td>\n",

The Colbran Family grows and processes their own coffee from the Baroida Estate, which we sell under that name, as well as buying coffee cherry direct from smallholder farmers in the area. Some of these are communities that the Colbrans have worked with for years, and others walk to the Baroida mill to sell their coffee fruit because they offer a premium price. These farmers can have as few as 100 trees, and produce only handfuls of coffee cherry at a time, but are situated from 1800 up to 2000 meters. I visited this season, and noticed that the price they were paying was higher than what other buyers, including multinational mills, were paying.

We helped support this project with our own donations, as well as donating a portion of our Kageyo sales to help see the effort through (so thanks to you too!). The association is made up of small farmers situated around this 2000 meter wet mill, and coffee in the region is some of the highest altitudes we see in all of Rwanda. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee planted in the region is Bourbon variety.

At just under 1500 meters, the milling site is at a much lower altitude than most of the coffee that comes in, many of the farms reaching above the 1800 meter mark. The station employs many grading techniques to separate out the top quality coffee, starting with the whole coffee cherry being submerged in tanks of water, and removing the low density coffee that floats to the top. The dry process coffee is then moved to raised drying tables where it will dry over the course of a few weeks. During this time, the cherry is turned by hand, and the workers continue to remove any coffee with physical defects they find along the way. All this care and attention results in a very uniform coffee for dry process, making it much easier to roast, as well as a very consistent brew.</td>\n",

This is a fully washed/wet process coffee, meaning that after the coffee cherry is removed from the seed, the remaining sticky fruit layer (mucilage) is removed by fermenting in a tank for several hours. Gitwe has several cement fermentation tanks, and should have no problem moving coffee through to the drying tables during the peak of the harvest. We were a little surprised by how deep the tanks are, and slightly worried that it might affect the coffee during fermentation. But after cupping a handful of samples, we were pleased with the resulting clean cups across the board. This is the peaberry selection, which are the small, nearly perfectly round beans. Peaberries occur when one of the two seeds inside the cherry fails to germinate. The remaining single coffee bean continues to mature, taking on the round shape of the cherry, rather than flattening out on one side. Pretty much every coffee shrub produces a few peaberries, and make up about 3% of the total yield. I roasted Gitwe to light and medium roast levels, and found that Full City roasting flattens out acidity too much for my taste, and mutes complex top notes found at City and City+.</td>\n",

The wet mill sits at 1770 meters above sea level, and is buying cherry from small holder farmers in the surrounding villages of Nyamagabe. Most farmers have less than 1 hectare of coffee planted in Bourbon, as is largely the case for Rwanda. Kibirizi CWS does many different types of processing, including honey. The honey process involves depulping the outer cherry, but leaving some of the fruit intact to the seed. Unlike the wet process method, the green seeds bypass a fermentation/washing step, going straight to the raised beds to dry. While not always true, honey processing can bring fruit flavors to the cup, which was what we tasted in this coffee. It also produces a high instance of chaff, which is normal for honeys. Just make sure to vacuum your roaster in between batches.</td>\n",

The Gitesi site is at 1740 meters, actually one of the lower areas surrounded by high ridges ranging up to 2000 meters where coffee is grown. More than 1,800 coffee farmers in the area supply Gitesi with cherries each year. The station fosters a relationship with the farmers by paying an additional dividend at the end of each season based on performance. Gitesi was started in 2005 and has been building capacity with each passing harvest. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee is Bourbon variety. We \"built\" this lot by looking at all their day lot batches and combining the best ones. We found some excellent process batches from the middle harvest. Gitesi has earned top placement at COE (\"Cup of Excellence\") more than once, and  continues to produce competition level coffees.</td>\n",

Bourbon is the dominant cultivar in this region and farmers delivering to Ngororero are scattered across an altitude range of 1600 to 2000 meters above sea level.

The wet mill isits at 1800 meters, with coffee being grown in the area up to 1950 meters. Mutovu Coffee is fairly small compared to many of the other coops and washing stations we buy from, estimated output this year at 2 containers of coffee (roughly 85,000 lbs of milled coffee - twice the amount from when they started). Each farmer supplies their own cherries to the station, as well as collects cherries from their neighbors. We have been buying Mutovu every year since they were established, as well as visiting the coop on every trip to Rwanda we make. Each year we're seeing improvements at the mill, last year's included upgraded milling equipment, new drying beds and a brand new warehouse to better store their parchment coffee. They received CAFE Practices certification too, part of which which means they are separating process batches by day of delivery, a first step in identifying different levels of quality.</td>\n",

They promoted a station worker from another wet mill to run Nyaco, who showed a strong understanding of operations. It's nice to see that type of promotion happening from within. The mill is situated at 1700 meters bove sea level, and coffee is likely growing as high as 1900 meters. Oh, and Nyaco is pronounced \"Nacho\", which makes it easy for me to remember!

       "      <td>The coffee from Tumba washing station wason my radar for years before we first bought it almost a decade ago. When I first tasted it, the sweetness and bright acidic snap in the cup made a great impression. But at the time I noticed varied quality from one cup to the next, and a lack of consistency can mean problems in the processing. For a coffee buyer, it signifies that what you taste now might not be what you get upon importation. The backstory at the time was Tumba Station was a private processing wet mill that had 2 owners with very different ideas of quality and how to run a mill. Fast forward a few years, and we found ourselves purchasing Tumba for the first time under a very different light. A local teacher in the Tumba area for which the mill is named, had taken over all aspects, and the coffee was consistent in every cup ... and amazingly good! Venustre Mugraneza, the teacher, is esteemed in the local community and has been systematically improving the mill. The best coffee cherries (those that make up this lot) are dried in a special area of raised beds and receive focused handpicking by the farmers. Tumba is situated at 1825 meters in the Rulindo district, where we've also sourced the excellent Cocatu Cooperative lots.</td>\n",

Topping out around 1900 meters above sea level, Acacia Hills estate is supposedly the highest altitude coffee farm in this region. The estate was established in the 1960's, but coffee has been growing here much longer. Coffee was initially planted here by a group of Germans in the 1930's, a vestige of colonialist settlements in the region. In 2007, the farm was purchased as a joint venture by local Tanzanian coffee farmers, Leon and Aideen Christianakis, and a coffee roaster in Portland, Mark Stell. Since taking ownership, the group has focused on improving the quality through farm renovation, new plantings, soil analysis, and refining the post harvest processes. This is a dry process coffee, which means the seeds are dried with the cherry still intact. This can lead to fruity flavors in the cup, and characteristics like body, and low levels of acidity. This lot displayed lots of rustic fruits in our assessment, and with very nice bittersweetness that makes it well-suited for middle to dark roast levels.</td>\n",

Why it's not a go-to East African coffee is a complicated question, but it just doesn't grab the same level of attention as neighboring Kenya, (or Burundi and Rwanda for that matter), and it should! Tanzanian coffee can fruited, bright, and just as complex as those in surrounding countries. The coffees of Kanji Lalji are a good example of this. Kanji Lalji is a larger farm owned by a family of the same name, located near Vwawa town in the Igamba district. While our other Tanzania coffees come from smallholders that form cooperative groups, Kanji Lalji is in a different position. The farm has an experienced agronomist, Eliot Swila (photo holding the baby coffee plant), who oversees their unique grafting method to bind the variety called Nylon locally (N39a, a Bourbon type) to drought-resistant Mbozi Compact roots. It's not high-tech in any way, but its beyond the means of the small-holder farmer. And in fact Kanji Lalji does this in a test plot for the government that will ultimately be shared with all farmers if it proves viable to face the seasonal lack of water in the area. All of that is a bit of a fascinating footnote: the lots we selected from Kanji Lalji are from their oldest trees, which are the original Mbozi Mission Bourbon variety. The farm has been managed for decades by Willy, a real character; a 79 year old Swiss expat, sparing in words, but clearly a man with a depth of coffee farming experience that shows in everything he does at Kanji Lalji farm.</td>\n",

All others were mixed to form \"Sana'ani coffee\" with decidedly mixed outcomes. But coffee in Bani Matari is a bit different, tall old-growth trees that appear like a fruit orchard than a typical coffee farm (well, NO coffee production in Yemen looks like a coffee farm anywhere else!). This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. This lot is made up of coffee from roughly 100 farmers in Bani Matari, who on average have 1000 trees planted on less than 1/2 hectare of land. Altitude is extremely high, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This year's buying was focused around coffee from four regions, Matari, Sharqui Haraz, Hajjah, and Hiwari, and this peaberry lot is a blend from all four areas. Peaberries occur naturally on every coffee tree, but in very small amount (typically &lt; 5% of the harvest). What happens is, one of two embryos inside the coffee cherry fails to germinate, leaving the other behind to take on a rounded shape as it matures. They tend to be separated out from the regular \"flats\" during the dry milling process where coffee is separated by size using large mechanized screen sorters. At the end of our buying, Fatoum Muslot, who oversees operations at this source, asked us if we wanted to buy the peaberries that were separated out from each of the lots we purchased. What that means is, this peaberry lot is the same coffee as the others on our site, just the small peaberry beans that were sorted out from the rest. That fact really makes it an interesting counterpoint to any of the others we have. This lot was secured through Fatoum, who took over the Pearl of Tehama export business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality.

Altitude is extremely high in these areas, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. This It's been a few years now since we've picked up Yemeni coffee, not necessarily by choice, but mainly due to the difficulties exporting from a country at war. The situation there is still quite dire, and I'm amazed that anything is making it out of the country. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.</td>\n",

If you travel west on the road from the capital Sana'a, toward Hodeidah on the Red Sea, you will pass quite close to Haraz, as I did when traveling to Yemen a several years back. I visited an amazing zone within Haraz with towering, ancient stone villages, like castles precariously perched atop steep precipice. It was incredibly dramatic. All the coffee here is grown on terraces, since little land exists that is flat, except for the lowland deserts. The coffee is hauled up remarkably steep slopes, carried in small amounts, most often by donkey. This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the operations, she has worked to implement quality-focused practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. Roughly 140 farmers are contributing to this regional blend, nd the altitude of the farms hover around 2200 meters above sea level. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, and shipping in Ecotact has really helped with the long transit times from Yemen.

       "      <td>Wet-process India Arabica coffees are very mild coffees when they are correctly picked and processed. But much of the coffee is grown at relatively low altitudes and poorly processed and prepared. There is a lot of regular commercial grade India Arabica. Even when well done, the coffees can be \"softish\" physically and in flavor. Soft coffees from low altitudes are more difficult to roast (especially in small home roasters I believe). The result can be ashy flavors, and greater risk of scorching or tipping the coffee. That's why I have been very impressed with this new crop arrival of Pearl Mountain Peaberry. This coffee plantation was planted in 1920 by Shivappaiya Patre, who cultivated the estate and called it Ratnagiri which when translated to English means Pearl Mountain. This estate has now been passed on to the 3rd generation of Estate owners, Rohith and Ashok Patre. The coffee is planted between 1200 and 1500 meters in a zone of the Western Ghat mountains that gets consistently heavy rainfall. The coffee on the farm is interplanted with pepper vines (which are grown on the canopy of large shade trees) and cardamom groves. The Patre family is extremely quality conscious. The coffee is grown under shade trees midst pepper vines and cardamom groves. The carefully picked cherries are sorted prior to pulping, fermented between 42 and 72 hours and hand-washed in water from clear mountain streams. The mild vibrance and clean cup taste really sets this Indian Arabica coffee apart from the mirky, unclean flavors we find often in India wet-process coffees, which are generally more commercial-level coffees.</td>\n",

Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste!

Beneficio Cerro Alto was one of the earliest micro-mills to be erected in the early 2000's, and has since achieved carbon neutral certification. While they produce full honey and natural process coffees too, this is a \"white honey\" process that is the standard in Costa Rica, and their version of a \"fully washed\" coffee. The biggest difference between traditional wet processing and white honey is that the coffee is not fermented to remove the mucilage. The coffee is processed in a mechanical demucilager which are capable of removing most of the sticky fruit mucilage without a fermentation step. The coffee is still soaked in clean water and then agitated for cleaning, but there is a very thin layer of fruit still intact during the drying phase. This type of process tends to produce the more vibrant, clean Costa Rican coffees, though they still shed a lot more chaff than you're average wet process coffee during roasting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This coffee from Hacienda Sonora is part of a family operation that goes back five generations in Costa Rica's West Valley region. The Guardia family have farmed coffee here for more than 100 years, historically selling their harvest to large mills, as was the norm. That all changed in the late 90's with the micro-mill revolution that swept Costa Rica, and, seeing value in controlling their coffee quality through to export, the family erected their own small milling operation at their farm. Currently under the management of Diego Guardia, the farm have decided to move away from more water intensive process methods, favoring honey and dry process instead. This 18 bag lot is considered a \"yellow honey\", in that roughly 50% of the fruit mucilage is left intact after depulping, and isn't removed until after the coffee is fully dried (to 10-11% moisture). This process method can impact the cup flavors and physical characteristics too. In the case of this coffee, it possesses fruit and wine-like notes, big body, no doubt tied to process method. The beans also look a little darker when roasting, and produce more chaff, both due to the fact that the seeds have more silver skin than a fully washed, wet process coffee. Hacienda Sonora sits at 1300 meters above sea level, and is planted in a variety of cultivars, including this \"Centroamericano\" separation, which is a first generation hybrid with some resistance to leaf rust. We also purchased a fully natural (dry process) lot from Sonora that comes later in the year.</td>\n",

They focus on organic production, and while coffee is central, their work goes beyond that. They provide technical assistance to farmers, and establish community-based programs that support primary education, and address issues like gender equity, and food scarcity. This particular dry process lot is from farmers in the indigenous Mayan region of Quiche (\"K'iche' \"), one of the most densely populated Departments in Guatemala. Much of the coffee growing areas are settled along the Chuacús mountain range that runs from El Quiche to Baja Verapaz, and farms for this coffee range from 1600 to 1700 meters above sea level. A few years back the cooperative built a wet mill and processing site in the town of Joyabaj, centralizing the cherry collection from surrounding villages, and allowing for greater quality control. This is a dry process coffee, meaning the whole coffee cherries are dried with green seeds still inside. It takes a lot longer to dry whole cherry than the wet process method, which can lead to fruity flavors, body, and lower acidity, which is what we found in this coffee. This lot also holds Fair Trade and Organic certifications.</td>\n",

Both farms are renowned for producing exceptional quality coffees, and have been recognized by many an international jury, and roasters around the world. It's also a well-known fact that Aurelio is one of the kindest, gentlest souls you'll ever meet, which certainly helps sweeten the deal! Punta del Cerro sits at an altitude of 1750 meters above sea level near Peña Roja town in La Libertad, and is planted in Bourbon and Caturra coffee cultivars. Aurelio's family have deep coffee roots in the region and have built a network that extends well beyond the extended family. They act as representatives of smallholder coffee farmers in the region, to some extent, assisting with post-harvest processing, and working closely with international buyers who pay premium prices for high quality coffee. He and his brother Aler recently erected a wet mill in Injerto town that is set up to handle a fairly high volume of coffee during the harvest peak. They are set up with plenty of outdoor patio space, as well as an indoor drying room that at the moment is reserved for natural and honey process coffees.</td>\n",

This area is one of the most well shaded that I've seen in Central America. The coffee trees are protected under an excellent canopy. Another unique aspect of this region is the heavy dose Typica varietals we've found planted among the Bourbon and Caturra. This most definitely lends to the also unique flavor profile we find in Patzún. Processing here is fairly standard as far as Guatemala is considered. After depulping the coffee beans are fermented up to 24 hours, washed in long channels and sun-dried on patios.</td>\n",

This lush, high-land valley boasts a dramatic landscape of jutting cliffs and seemingly endless green as far as you can see. Farmers in the region, grow coffee on small parcels of land often adjacent to where they live - in many cases less than one hectare of coffee. His farm sits at 1700 meters above sea level and is planted with mostly Bourbon, though Caturra, Catuaí  are widely planted in the region too. Processing is managed locally, each farmer de-pulping and fermenting their coffee at home, or at a neighbor's, then laying it out to dry on concrete patios. Slight variations in processing technic can make for unique cup profiles from one neighbor's coffee to the next. The dry parchment coffee is transported to a dry milling facility in Huehuetenango town where it is hulled, sorted and prepared for export.

This lush, high-land valley boasts a dramatic landscape of jutting cliffs and seemingly endless green as far as you can see. Farmers in the region, grow coffee on small parcels of land often adjacent to where they live - in many cases less than one hectare of coffee. Caturra, Catuaí and Bourbon are widely planted varietals, but you the occasional Typica trees mixed in too. Processing is managed locally, each farmer de-pulping and fermenting their coffee at home, or at a neighbor's, then laying it out to dry on concrete patios. Slight variations in processing technic can make for unique cup profiles from one neighbor's coffee to the next. The dry parchment coffee is transported to a dry milling facility in Huehuetenango town where it is hulled, sorted and prepared for export.

Specifically, this small lot is a blend of coffees from six small producers in the growing areas of Santa Barbara, Cuilco, La Libertad and San Pedro Necta. In the past, small coffee producers in this area had few options when selling their coffee locally; they could take it to the large mills down at lower elevations and get paid the going rate, or they could sell it to \"coyotes\" who drive the dirt roads in their trucks paying cash for coffee. Neither offered any extra price for quality, even though the coffees were grown higher and tended with greater care than the big farms down at lower elevations. We partnered with local coffee people to offer higher prices if the farmers could meet our quality expectations in the cup, and this lot is testament to that success. Given that the localities where we are buying coffee are little more than extended family groups, we have found if we involve a brother or sister, they will tell all their coffee-farming kin and soon we have a network of farmers interested in our project. We wrote an in-depth and detailed description of the project as well.</td>\n",

The San Pedro growing region is perched high in the mountainous Huehuetenango, where farm altitude ranges from 1800 - 2000 meters above sea level. This coffee comes to us through a joint-effort between us and a San Pedro Necta micro-mill owner who, through the years, has introduced us to neighbors in his village, as well as in many of the surrounding townships nearby. He and his wife run an export business in Huehuetenango town, and have set up a really nice coffee lab where they roast and cup coffees, and ultimately separate out the different quality tiers together. It's always such a pleasure to visit and cup with them! It helps us greatly to enlist local support, folks who not only know the land but also the local farmers. We put in quite a bit of work ourselves, tasting many rounds of samples in order to identify the premium-level coffees, as well as make several trips to the area each year meeting with farmers and collecting information. This is part of our \"Proyecto Xinabajul\" in Huehuetenango, which you can read an in-depth and detailed description of the HERE.</td>\n",

First, it was his grandfather's land that he and his father tended. That land was passed on to his father when he was in his teens, and now in his early 20's, Juan Carlos has 1 hectare of coffee to call his own. His farm is called \"Los Pimientas\", and is located in Las Flores, Santa Barbara, at roughly 1300 meters above sea level. Being a security guard at the nearby San Vicente mill, Juan Carlos witnessed how other coffee farmers were benefitting from investing in their farms, specific cultivars, and changing their harvest and post-harvest practices. Seeing how others were gaining a clear return on a structured farming approach, Juan Carlos decided to follow suit. With the help and guidance of the San Vicente team, he started experimenting with different process techniques, and planted his farm with 75% Parainema, and 25% Gesha. This is a dry process version of his Parainema coffee. Parainema is a type of Sarchimor (Sarchimor = cross between Villa Sarchi and Timor Hybrid) that was originally produced in Costa Rica, and introduced in Honduras within the last decade. The name \"Parainema\" came about in the growing area of Paraiso, on Honduras' Southeastern border. The name itself is a hybrid of Paraiso and nematode (\"Parai\" + \"nema\"), of which the cultivar is resistant to. Grown in higher altitudes, Parainema is known to exhibit unique aromatic and herbal qualities, which is what we were looking for when cup testing several cultivar separations.</td>\n",

After initially selling to the commercial market, Alexis was introduced to Beneficio San Vicente, who helped him agronomical support, and connecting him with the international Specialty market. His coffee is wet processed, but with a long, 32 hour fermentation. I'd venture that the extended fermentation time is responsible for some of the fruit flavors we picked up on, a welcome addition to an otherwise bittersweet cup.

Unfortunately, a coffee leaf rust outbreak about a decade later wiped out much of coffee in the area, nearly decimating the once lucrative coffee production as well. Undeterred, families replanted their farms, this time diversifying the coffee cultivars with disease-resistant hybrids, but also keeping any healthy Pacas/Typica that remained. Within a few years, the initial new plantings produced their first real harvest, revitalizing the coffee community in Cabañas. It was during the time of replanting that 3 farmers joined together to build a small wet mill and drying station, where local farmers could process their harvest down to the green coffee. The idea was to give community members a more direct link in the supply chain, not to mention, the opportunity to control quality from coffee cherry, all the way down to the dried green coffee in parchment. This lot is made up of coffees from 20 farmers in the town of Los Planes, within the Municipality of Cabañas. A little more than half of the coffee trees grown here are disease-resistant hybrids such as Lempira, and Ihcafe, along with the original Pacas, and Catuaí (cross of Mundo Novo, and Caturra). Most of the farms are about 2.5 hectares in size, and situated at an average altitude of 1650 meters above sea level. This coffee was purchased through Beneficio San Vicente, who also manage the dry milling and exportation. It's worth noting that the green looks rustic, and a little more like a honey processed than washed, even though it is the latter. We spotted several secondary defects, like insect damage, unripe coffee, and chipped beans. We did not pick any of these out from the coffee we roasted for review. See photo.</td>\n",

Shortly after, Edwin's neighbor told him of a new varietal produced in Honduras called \"Parainema\". The name itself is a hybrid of Paraiso and nematode (\"Parai\" + \"nema\"), of which the cultivar is resistant to. Perhaps just as important, it's known for producing a good cup, which Edwin's neighbor could attest to having won the Cup of Excellence competition in Honduras that year. Edwin planted his 1/2 hectare in this variety and the rest is history. Edwin and his wife Jenny have since expanded their farm (\"El Plan\") to 2 hectares, 1/2 of which is planted in Parainema. Their 1400 meter farm is located in Las Flores village, within the Santa Barbara department. The family has been working with Beneficio San Vicente to improve their harvest/post-harvest practices, as well as to access a greater segment of the Specialty Coffee market.</td>\n",

It seems to be grown mostly in Nicaragua although I have found nice examples in El Salvador too. Buenos Aires is a rather low farm compared to other origins we buy, with this lot coming from about 1200 meters. This coffee is wet processed, which means that the whole cherry is mechanically separated from the coffee seed, and then the sticky layer of mucilage is broken down and removed using overnight wet fermentation. This tends to produce higher acidity levels, and often a cleaner, more clear set of cup flavors all around. Maracturra can be tricky to roast due to the enormous bean size requiring a little extra time to develop the inside of the bean. If you have the ability to control heat on your roaster, try a \"slow and low\" approach, slightly extending the beginning roast leg before 1st crack in order to produce a little more roast consistency from the inside out.</td>\n",

It is located in the Dipilto area, in an area with a pleasant microclimate, with ample sun for drying coffee. They mechanically wash the coffee using a Penagos depulper that removes the coffee cherry and mucilage layer in one pass, not relying on fermentation to break down the sticky fruit. The coffee is then soaked in tanks overnight with fresh water to further clean the seed before washing in long cement channels where any remaining fruit is removed by agitating the coffee with long wooden paddles as it moves to the end. The coffee is transported from the beneficio to Buenos Aires dry mill in Ocotal where it is dried and prepared for export.</td>\n",

But when I hear \"Java\" (or Gesha for that matter!), my ears perk up a bit. This unique cultivar came to Central America by way of Cameroon, through transfer and cultivation on the isle of Java. It resembles some Ethiopian heirlooms in physical appearance, and also tends to produce aromatic cup when roasted light. In a word, it's interesting! Most farms we buy Java from only grow a small amount. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to come across this uncharacteristically large lot from Los Altiplanos, who've gone all in with this unique cultivar. Their 78 hectare farm has a large portion of the farm devoted to Java, and this lot we selected was a whopping 49 bags! The Los Altiplanos farm is owned and managed by Ricardo Cuadra, whose family have been growing coffee in this region for more than 100 years. His farm is located near Jinotega, near the mountain reserve of Datanli el Diablo, with altitudes reaching upwards of 1300 meters. We have not visited Ricardo's farm, but hope to next harvest.</td>\n",

This 150 hectare farm and processing site is owned and operated by Mesfin Dabessa and his family. They are producing both dry process and fully washed coffees, having erected a washing station onsite back in 2015. This lot is a dry process coffee, where the whole cherry is laid to dry on raised beds and not removed until both fruit and seed (green \"bean\") are down to 10-11% moisture. We've found that adding fruitier naturals to the equation helps lock in some of what we think of as Ethiopian origin characteristics, which is what we've done here. Wolenso Dabessa was acquired as part of a land grant by the government in 2008, where large areas of semi-forested area were given to farmers with the idea that planting coffee while preserving the natural forest canopy would be an improvement toward sustainability. While this is where Dabessa got his start, his father's history growing coffee in the region dates back to 1946. Dabessa's washing station happens to be on the site of his original farm. The farm and mill sit at around 1800 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown up to 2000. Check out the video tour we put together of Wolenso Dabessa HERE. We sent a chunk of this coffee off for decaffeination at Swiss Water Coffee in Vancouver, BC. and are thrilled with the results. The Swiss decaf method is one of the gentler processes, using only water to remove 99.9% of the decaf, and leaving some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact.</td>\n",

While it was originally a bit more limited in which islands were included, it is now commonly used to refer to the entire chain of Indonesian islands. We are using this name for a blend of Indonesian coffees we sourced, reserving small quantities of each for a custom Swiss Water decaf. This lot of Nusantara includes wet hulled coffee from the islands of Timor Leste, a typical body/bittersweet blend component that comes through loud and clear in decaf! In addition, we've added a really interesting \"honey labu\" processed Sumatran coffee, a hybrid honey-wet hulled processing technic that we started seeing in Aceh a few years back. Both coffees were grown around 1500 meters above sea level. The honey labu coffees we've purchased have tasted more in line with sweet, and sometimes fruited, honey process coffees, rather than herbal, earthy wet hulled. Together, they construct a chocolate-laden, big bodied, decaf, that is best roasted in the middle, City+ to Full City+ roast range. This is where it shows peak chocolate characteristics while retaining a nicely developed sweetness to balance the cup. Fantastic dual-use decaf that also makes a great base blending ingredient. Try 1:1 with Ethiopia Gera Goma SWP Decaf (click here for Coffee Shrub) for a Moka Java blend. This decaf was processed at the Swiss Water Decaf plant where their patented chemical-free, decaffeination process is employed using only water to remove 99.9% of the caffeine content.</td>\n",

Farmers sell their coffee in whole cherry to local milling stations where the coffee is then processed, in this case the Gatare wet mill, and Kanyege cooperative. This lot was initially wet processed before sending off to be decaffeinated. \"Milles Collines\", as Rwanda is commonly referred to, translates to \"the land of 1000 hills\" in French. The cooperatives and washing stations who contributed to this blend are situated in the villages at the tops of some of these \"collines\", affording access to the higher elevation coffees, and offering ease of delivery for these coffee farm members. Most farms in this area are situated between 1500 and 2000 meters above sea level. This is 100% Bourbon cultivar, which when grown at high altitudes produces a dense bean capable of producing a high level of sweetness. The decaffeination was handled by Swiss Water Decaf in Vancouver, BC (where we have all our decafs processed). Their chemical-free decaffeination process removes 99.9% of the caffeine, while leaving much of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. That means the tasty coffees we send off for decafffeination are returned with much of their original appeal. Read more about the Swiss Water Decaf process here.</td>\n",

With a full list of coffees from Indonesia and Ethiopia, the timing for this blend was right to blend a fruity dry process Ethiopia and earthy wet-huleled Sumatra, decaffeinated at the Swiss Water Process (\"SWP\") plant in Vancouver, BC. The goal of the blend was to produce a Moka Java version that showed big body, brooding bittersweetness when roasted dark, and with some dark fruit accent notes that can be tempered (or not) with roast development. The coffees that went into this blend really hit the mark. The \"original\" Moka Java was comprised of two of the earliest coffees to be exported from Yemen and Java, hence the name. I can honestly say, it's a resounding success and is hard to pinpoint as 'decaf' coffee at all! (It's worth noting that the high score should be taken in context of other decafs). This is an incredibly forgiving blend where bittersweetness is a prominent feature at a very wide range of roast levels.</td>\n",

It's the decaf version of our popular Altiplano blend, that we keep in stock most of the year. Like Altiplano, this blend is put together with balance in mind, choosing coffees that are fresh, offer sweetness and moderate acidity, and are capable of dense chocolate roast flavors when roasted dark. We favor coffees that work well as brewed coffee and espresso, and that show well at a variety of roast levels, so that we get a decaf that hits those same marks. Swiss Water decaf in Vancouver BC are a key ingredient in that last part. Their patented chemical-free water process method is one of the gentler methods out there, and we've found that the coffees we have processed by Swiss come back tasting great. All decaffeination methods impact flavor to some extent, but the Swiss process seems to leaves some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Send off a fruity coffee, get a fruity decaf in return. Or in this case, a sweet decaf with balanced low tones and modest acidity!</td>\n",

It's a good example of how processing can make a big impact on flavor. The first stage of processing involves first sealing the whole coffee cherry in barrels for 3 days, where an anaerobic fermentation starts in the airtight tanks. They they depulp the outer cherry, unlike the wet process method, where the sticky fruit mucilage is removed with fermentation, the coffee is dried with the fruit layer still intact. The coffee has a lot more silverskin than washed, and produces a lot more chaff during roasting. I'd advise vacuuming out your machine between roasts. The farms where this coffee is from are in close proximity to the Wawo Muda volcano on Flores island, benefiting from the nutrient rich soil in this high altitude zone (1500+ meters above sea level). Farmers in this area tend to grow a mix of older Typica trees and S795, commonly referred to as \"Jember\", a natural mutation of Typica and Liberica. Coffee is typically traded through cooperatives or coffee \"collectors\", this being the latter. It's from a few different collectors who gather from farmer groups in nearby areas such as Wolo Bobo, and Bajawa, all of it processed at a central station called Wawo Wae.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Monsooned coffees are stored in special warehouses until the Monsoon season comes around. The sides of the structure are opened and moist monsoon winds circulate around the coffee making it swell in size and take on a mellowed but aggressive flavor. This Monsooned Malabar is sourced from several farms in Southern India. Typically, the coffee is naturally processed, then spread on the floor of the special monsooning warehouse, raked and turned around by hand to enable them to soak in moisture of the humid winds. The monsooning process takes around 12 to 16 months of duration, where in the beans swell to twice their original size and turn a pale golden color. Then they do additional rounds of hand sorting to remove any coffee that did not expand properly, and the coffee is prepared for export. This is an extremely pungent cup with a unique combination of burnt-bittering flavors, caramel finish and potent earthy aspects. It is not for those who like a \"clean\" cup, or sweet coffees! By all standard definitions, this is a defective set of cup flavors, though still quite interesting, unique, and not to mention, useful. (It's been a key component in our Liquid Amber espresso blend since the beginning!) Monsooned Malabar gets a free pass from the coffee censors because of cultural tradition, history, and the fact that (while it doesn't conform to the traditional ideas of good coffee) it is in it's own right a unique coffee flavor. It has some use in espresso blending with a preparation of longer drum roasting and resting (after roasting) of 3+ days. There are Italian espresso roasting companies that use this coffee in their \"exotic\" blend offering, along with 2-3 other non-monsooned arabicas to even out the cup and provide aroma and some sweetness. Even as a drip/infusion brew, the coffee mellows after 2 days and the cup is more balanced so resting is key to best cup results. Please see the physical appearance of the coffee in that first photo, as it can be quite a shock if you've never seen Monsoon coffee before! It's pale white, slightly 'speckled'. We do our best to find the best quality all around, and think this is one of the cleanest looking lot we've seen in a long time!</td>\n",

Daeng first started coffee farming 50 years ago, planting a small amount of Typica near his home (apparently only 7 seedlings, a very small amount!). Since then, he's gone from selling to traders to becoming a trader himself, becoming somewhat of a representative for the coffee of his village. Most of the surrounding farms are planted in Typica (thanks to those original 7 seeds), and the locals look to Daen and his family for a more direct connection to the global market where they receive a better price for their coffee. Daen does different types of processes, this being a traditional dry process (\"natural\") lot, exemplary of the more fruit-forward cup that comes from this process method. There's approximately 2000 hectares of coffee planted in the villages that surround Topidi, with an altitude range of 1300 to 1500 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that while they are not certified, organic coffee farming is the default in this area.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This coffee comes from a quality-savvy coffee collector named Aulia who buys in the districts of Bebesen and Kute Panang, in Sumatra's Aceh province. Farms in these regions tend to span an altitude range from about 1300 to 1600 meters and are planted in older, long berry types (you'll see the long, canoe shaped beans) Abysinnia, Ateng and Tim Tim. In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs. This coffee is an anaerobic-wet hulled coffee, a hybrid of sorts that constructs incredibly complex cup flavors. The first step of this hybrid coffee process involves storing the whole cherry in a sealed environment, which is where the name \"anaerobic\" comes from (though not entirely correct, since there is still oxygen inside the barrels or bags used). While the cherry is fermenting in this closed system, the CO2 that is created during the process builds into a high pressure environment, that supposedly allows for a more controlled fermentation process. One thing's for sure, most of the anaerobic fermented coffees we've tried skew toward outlier fruit flavors, winey in character, and with lower acidity. This seems to be the case here, though tempered by the wet hulled/giling basah step that follows. The cherry and fruit are peeled straight from the fermentation tanks, and then dried the rest of the way on raised beds. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region. But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup of fruit and foresty flavors, big body, low toned, and complex through and through.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This coffee comes from a coffee farmer's cooperative, \"Koerintji Barokah Bersama\", in the Gunung Tujuh area, a higher elevation coffee zone around Mount Kerinci. The cooperative serves about 450 farmers in the area who are divided into 24 farmer groups, 4 of which are specifically women's farmer groups. Many of the farms in this area are planted in older Typica types and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level. This is a wet hulled coffee, also known as \"giling basah\". This is the typical process method in Sumatra and involves removing the parchment layer while the coffee is still wet, exposing it to the elements well before the coffee is stable. When handled well during the drying phase (like this coffee), this rustic process method yields an earth-toned, bodied cup, with mild acidity and syrupy sweetness, and the green bean taking on a dark green hue unlike wet or dry process coffees from other producing countries. Having roasted this coffee, I'm very pleased with the uniformity of roast color and the minimal quakers from underripe coffee making it through. Giling basah - and Sumatran coffee in general - has a reputation for being riddled with defects even at \"Grade 1\" standard. Our \"Appearance\" category score is a little on the high side as a sort of worse case scenario, even though the green I inspected looked much cleaner than this. I saw minimal broca damage for Sumatra (this is not a Latin American coffee), only a few unripe beans, and some broken beans. It's no Grade 1 Ethiopian coffee, but far better than your average Grade 1 Sumatra.</td>\n",

This is a dry process coffee, meaning the whole coffee cherry is laid to dry without any removal of the fruit. The dry times are quite long with all that wet, organic mass, usually upwards of 3-4 weeks time. The fermentation that occurs inside the cherry often leads to a fruity cup profile, bigger body, and muted acidity. The results can be wildly different than a wet processed batch from the same farm or station! It's a unique opportunity to taste just how profound an impact processing can have on the final cup profile.</td>\n",

In one sense, the coffees are processed in a less uniform way, each by a different individual farmer. But the differences in technique from one farmer to the next also lends to difference, and interest, and can heighten cup complexity. The village of Taurema is located in Eraulo, Letefoho, and at 1900 to 2000 meters above sea level, it's the highest region we are buying from. The Hatletegeo group is made up of around a dozen farmers, totaling roughly 100 hectares of land between them, though much of that is devoted to vegetables. Hatletegeo is a versatile coffee that proved to function well at medium-to-dark roast levels, and as both brewed coffee and espresso.

       "      <td>Viviana Aparecida's coffee farm \"Saco de Onca\" is located outside the city of Licínio de Almeida, in Brazil's Eastern state of Bahia. Her story is not all that uncommon. Viviana comes from a family of coffee farmers, and after reaching adulthood and acquiring a small piece of land from her grandfather, she decided to take the plunge herself. What's unique about Viviana's farm, and the Bahia region in general, is that there is a culture of small scale farming. I know we've called 50 hectare Brazilian estates \"small\" in some of our reviews, because in Brazil, that is considered small. But Viviana's 7 hectare farm is small on a global scale. Saco de Onca is situated on a sloping hillside, with shade trees interspersed. She is growing Catuaí, a cross between Mundo Novo and Caturra that is known for its high production yield, and short stature making it easy to pick. The latter is particularly helpful on a farm that employs selective hand harvesting. We have not visited Viviana, and I'm hoping to learn more about her processing methods next season. Her coffee is fruit forward in a way that is pretty unusual for Brazilian coffee. When cupping the offer sample, we noted it's wilder cup character, which we enjoyed, but we were unsure which way the fruit would go. I'm happy to report the cup is tasting sweet as ever, and the fruits provided an interesting flavor backdrop in both our City and Full City roasts.</td>\n",

Santa Ines is located in Carmo de Minas at 1100 meters, and this lot is 100% Yellow Bourbon cultivar. Yellow Bourbon is a sub-type that has fruit which ripens to a yellow color. It originated in Brazil. It is possible that Yellow Bourbon is a natural mutation of a cross between Bourbon and a yellow-fruited Typica called \"Amarelo de Botocatu\". Bourbon coffees are named for the island in the India Ocean where French colonists grew it. It's not so different in the cup than Red Bourbon, but I have noticed higher sugar levels in the Yellow fruit, and the plant has different physical properties.</td>\n",

It is located in Carmo de Minas in the Mantiqueira Mountain area and is a farm we've purchased coffee from for several years now. The photo on the landing page is a shot from above the farm, you can see the rows of coffee planted in the valley below the mountain range, as well as in the foothills. This 235 hectare farm is situated at 1250 meters, and has a mix of varietals including Bourbon, Acaia, and Icatu. This lot is a Red Bourbon separation from their farm, and Dry Process method. Dry process coffees are often casually referred to as \"naturals\", and only involves laying whole cherry to dry on cement patios. It can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks to dry the entire cherry and seed to stable levels (roughly 11% moisture), during which a fermentation occurs within the cherries. Sometimes this leads to fruity flavors, though not the case with this lot from Sertao. This coffee has what I think of as classic Brazilian cup characteristics that are body, low acidity, chocolate, and nut. It's a good coffee for espresso, or to use in a blend. Dry process coffees produce more chaff than a wet process, and you're going to want to vacuum out your roaster between batches.</td>\n",

His coffee stood out as having interesting herbal accents that imparted a sort of \"floral\" hint in the cup, along with rustic flavors of a good dry process Brazilian coffee. It certainly grabbed our attention! Altitude in the growing region surrounding Santo Antônio do Amparo tops out around 1000 meters, and you see a lot of Bourbon, Catuaí, and Mundo Novo growing. This is a dry process lot from the farm, one of the oldest methods of processing coffee down to the green seed. In contrast to the wet process method, or even pulp natural, which is the other common way of processing coffee in Brazil, dry processing involves leaving the coffee cherry intact during the entire drying phase, until the green seed within reaches roughly 11% moisture. This can take upwards of 4 weeks time, depending on the weather.</td>\n",

The farm has stood much longer than the Junqueira family has owned it, dating back to the mid 1800's when the first coffee was planted and the original farm house was built. The farm is located just outside of Santa Rita do Sacupaí in the Mantiqueira Region of Minas Gerais. The land at São José is actually 508 hectares, much of which is still natural forest. It requires a fairly large team to manage just the part planted in coffee, and there are 22 permanent employees year round, as well as 100 seasonal workers who join for the harvest. The farm enjoys a modest altitude of 1200 meters above sea level, and is currently planted in Mundo Novo, Acaiá, Catuaí Amarelo, Catuaí Vermelho, Arara, and Catucaí. While much of Brazil coffee farmers have turned to harvesting machinery, the Junqueira family recognizes the importance of selecting ripe cherries in order to produce top grades, and has therefore chosen to stick with selective harvesting by hand. This lot is a pulp natural process which is about as closed to a fully washed coffee as you will get in Brazil, and quite similar to a mild honey process method in Costa Rica. The coffee cherry and much of the fruit are removed with depulping machinery, and then the seed is laid to dry with fruit mucilage still intact. Pulp naturals often possess more balanced flavors than dry process coffee, less fruited, and can still be big-bodied and lower acid coffees, making them a great choice for espresso and blending.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This decaf was sourced from small producers near Buesaco town, in Colombia's Nariño Department. We chose the coffees specifically for decaffeination, based on the cup profiles having some mild fruit characteristics and pronounced acidity. In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate (\"EA\"). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname \"sugar cane decaf\", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want - including those that went into this decaf. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters, and each contributing lot in this batch are wet process coffees.</td>\n",

This is technically Cauca, but only a stones throw from the border with Huila. \"Chorrera\" is the Spanish word for stream. And while I shouldn't be surprised that when I asked folks in San Vicente what they call the small cascading waterfall and stream that cuts through town, they sort of shrugged their shoulders and said, \"La Chorrera\", I expected something a little less on the nose! This particular lot comprises coffee from 10 different farmers in San Vicente and the surrounding towns. We hiked to farms just above 2000 meters in San Vicente, and you could still see coffee growing higher on the surrounding ridge that was at least 100 meters higher. You see a lot of the typical varieties growing, Colombia, and Caturra, with smaller amounts of Typica, Bourbon, and Castillo. Farmers typically process their coffee on small depulping machines used to remove the outer cherry, and either hand-cranked, or run with small gas motors. The coffee is also dried in parabolic drying rooms, which are essentially outdoor structures that consist of a wooden frame and tarpaulin walls/roof with some kind of venting for airflow. They are typically built on a cement slab that the coffee dries on, or raised beds are erected inside.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Inzá is a province located in Southwestern Colombia within the greater Department of Cauca. As you make the drive from La Plata to Inzá, you follow the Rio Paez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the the villages whose coffees make up this blend. Like much of Colombia, Cauca is home to some very high altitude farms, many breaching the 2000 meter mark. This particular lot is a blend of coffees from a few of the neighboring Veredas within the region, altitudes ranging from 1500 - 2000+ meters. There's a very small amount from nearby Páez town, as well. The way we make up these regional blends is by cupping several samples from the individual farms, separating out those that meet a certain cup criteria, and then blending them together. It's a great benefit to us (and not to mention the cup) having this level of quality control with our Colombian blends. Wet processing is traditional in the region, many using old-style hand cranked pulpers, fermenting and washing in the same tank and then drying out on raised, covered beds. This last part is key in facilitating even and gentle drying of the parchment, helping to keep the protective parchment layer intact as the internal moisture dips to around 11 - 12% over the course of a few days to 2 weeks (depending on the micro-climate). Most farms have a healthy amount of Caturra planted, as well as some Timor hybrids (like Variedad Colombia and Tabi) that were heavily promoted for disease resistance.</td>\n",

The alliance aims to bridge market access directly to female farmers in Chirinos, and has grown to more than 200 members in its first two years. The farms range in altitude from 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level. Most farmers are growing a mix of cultivars, which typically include some combination of Caturra, Bourbon, Typica, Pache, and Catimor. Farmers have been trained to pick and process the varieties separately as a quality control measure, and this lot is a mix of Pache (natural mutation of Typica), and Catimor. This is a fully washed, \"wet process\" coffee, meaning the cherries are depulped, and the seeds are then fermented and washed in water to remove the sticky layer of mucilage. The coffee is dried on patios for up to 2 weeks in order to get the moisture down to roughly 11% before performing the final preparation for export.</td>\n",

The coffee is planted across an altitude range of 1500 to 1900 meters above sea level, and you see a broad selection of coffee cultivars including Caturra, Typica, Bourbon, Pache, Catuaí, and Catimor. The intermediary they work with have set up a program to incentivize farmers to replant their Catimor with other disease resistant hybrids that offer higher cup quality. I don't know that this is intentional, but in a way, having the disease-resistant hybrids in the mix helps hedge their risk against issues of coffee leaf rust and other coffee plant diseases that can spread throughout a crop if not treated right away. Most farmers use water-conserving mechanical demucilagers to process their coffee, leaving behind as much of the fruit as possible so that the moisture within will promote a fermentation without having the use water. They employ a variety of drying methods including polypropylene tents, cement patios, and raised beds, and the coffee is then dried until it reaches a safe moisture range of 9 - 11% before bagging up to rest.</td>\n",

Altitude in this area spans 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level, and the hilly peaks, and converging microclimates tend to be well suited for coffee production. There are a number of young and forward thinking producers in this area who are working to employ sustainable crop management through the use of both organic and synthetic fertilizers to replenish micro-organisms in the soil and enhance productivity and general plant health. This coffee is a blend of dry process lots from the group, and is a typical method of production. Farmers are drying whole cherries for up to 30 days, then storing the dried coffee in polyethylene bags for freshness, before eventually being moved to the dry mill for final sorting. The dry process method is known to imparting big fruit flavors, body, and milder acidity in the cup. I can honestly say that all of these aspects ring true here!</td>\n",

He manages the production at his small farm closely, along with his family, and the four pickers he hires during the harvest season. Most of his harvest is wet processed. However, this 25 bag lot is a dry process coffee, where the coffee is dried with the cherry still intact on patios in the sun. The time it takes to dry the seeds inside down to 10-11% moisture is 3-4 weeks, roughly three times the time it takes to dry a fully washed coffee. While not promised, this process method can impart fruity flavors in the cup, and big body, which is what we tasted in Edilberto's coffee.</td>\n",

Though not the only farmer to do this, Luz bags up the coffee cherry from the day's harvest and seals them up for about 24 hours before processing. The idea is to start fermentation within the cherry in the hopes of translating to a more complex cup (often realized as an increase in fruited notes). She and her husband also employ a somewhat long fermentation times (36 hours) which can have a similar affect on flavor profile. Once dry, the coffee is stored in polyethylene sacks that remain covered until transport in order to help preserve the quality. The coffee is still in it's outer parchment layer too, which also helps with freshness, and won't be removed until ready for export.

This is a fully washed coffee, wet processed by the farmers who then deliver their coffee in dry parchment (the green bean with the thin parchment layer still intact) to a warehouse in Cajamarca where it is graded and purchased. The group who set up this buying operation are working to register all the farmers they buy from in order to help isolate different quality tiers, but also be able to issue the initial payments and any quality premiums themselves, something that was lacking when they were buying through more traditional avenues. It doesn't help that the roads leading to Huabal and within the district are much more rustic than some of their neighbors, limiting access to farmers in this region.</td>\n",

So it stands to reason that blending all Central American coffees would only enhance those aspects even more, right? After tasting this trio all blended together, the answer is a resounding \"yes\". \"Altiplano\" is the word we are using for high plains, not to be confused with THE Altiplano in South America. From the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica, to the Los Cuchumatanes in Guatemala, to the Los Arados mountains in Nicaragua, we bring in a wide variety of coffees with unique cup profile, and that all work extremely well as espresso. Blended together, the resulting cup or espresso has balance, and with an acidity that is controlled by roast development. This blend was built with espresso in mind, and includes all wet-process coffees that offer balanced flavors, body, and at least one has moderate acidity too. Roasting to City+ will have the highest tones in the cup, though we prefer at least Full City in our espresso machine. Full City/Full City+ will produce a more \"classic\" espresso profile with chocolate roast pungency, deep sweetness, and a fruited acidity that to me has an orange zest-like quality (though the cup is far from \"fruity\"). Altiplano is seasonal blend, and we'll be rotating new coffees in as they become available, updating the review when necessary.</td>\n",

Working under the codename of the \"Donkey Blend\" (don't ask how all these ridiculous names started ---I think it was George's fault) we came up with this. It is intended to be used several ways. As an all-decaf espresso blend I wanted it to work well under a wide variety of roasting conditions, in terms of both lighter Northern Italian type espresso roasts (the equivalent of a Full City to Vienna Roast) and the darker Southern Italian type roast (roasted to a French roast). I also wanted a good espresso from both air and drum roasters, and I wanted good crema. This is a lot to ask from a decaf, but I think this blend works very well. While origin tastes are muted in decafs, I think the bittersweet roast tastes from this blend are very good. My second focus was having the blend not have too much character so that it can be used as a base blend for a \"low-caf\" espresso. This means it should work well as 50-75% of your blend where you add other caffeinated coffees to give more aromatics and flavor: my choice would be a Ethiopian Harar, or a Central American (see our Blending Basics article for more).

In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of \"espresso\" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today!

For those who appreciate both, it's a match made in heaven, and I think you'll find the dark-toned fruits to be quite complimentary to the moderate level of cocoa roast flavors that comes with Full City to Full City+ roasts. The current blend (August 2023) is 1/3 wet process Ethiopia, which brought a slight floral aroma to the chocolatey low tones and fruits that find equal footing. That said, the wet process ingredient was chosen based on body and sweetness more than anything else. Full City is a good starting point, or roughly 30F post 1st Crack if your roaster has a thermocouple. You also achieve a fairly uniform roast coloring at this roast level, but being all dry process coffees, you should still expect some variation. Full City+ roasts will tone down the fruit quite a bit, and is where I think this Ethiopian blend works for milk drinks.

I wanted it also to be complex and hint at all of those tastes, and more. Here's the product of a lot of overly-caffeinated days of experimentation: the Liquid Amber Espresso Blend. It is named for the rich color and multitude of crema it produces. The blend was fairly complex to come up with ... after I found the general tastes I wanted, emerging from aroma and first sip through the very long aftertaste (if I don't cleanse my palate with water I will taste this coffee for a very......long.....time) I needed to play with the exact percentages. The specific blend, hey ... it is my secret! But I will tell you that the 5 coffees that really worked toward the flavor goal I imagined ended up surprising even me! We've refined the recipe over the year, and at the moment, there's a washed Central, wet-hulled Indonesia, a monsooned coffee, and even a modicum of quality Robusta. And to keep this a mystery, the blend contains some coffees not on our list. I admit this is a pretty wacky blend by the current fashion in espresso toward lighter-roasted and acidic coffees; it's downright dated really. But it works in its own way. Some emphasis here is on the physical character of the espresso, hence the use of the monsooned coffee, which has properties in terms of crema that no other coffee possesses. Even in cupping the dynamics of the foam/bubbles are clearly different from other coffees due to the changes in the bean from the monsoon processing technique.</td>\n",

The components are all dry-processed coffees from Yemen, Ethiopia and small amount of Brazilian coffee. Between these three, we find an espresso on the rustic and exotic side, some fruit-forward character and earth-toned bittersweetness in full effect. It's great as espresso in the Full City+ to Vienna roast territory, and the mix of dry process coffees handle well in the roaster, regardless of the difference in density when sticking to the recommended roast range. Full City roasts may show some variance, and I recommend taking your roasts closer to Full City+ development which will help afford roast evenness. Slowly ramping up the heat will also help in this effort if your roaster has manual heat control. For those without (like a popper for example), try slowing your roast by slightly overloading the chamber and I wouldn't stop the roast development until you're on the heels of 2nd snaps. (I \"overload\" the roast chamber by first turning the popper on, then adding coffee until just after it stops moving - it should only take a few seconds to get the coffee moving again). A balance of sweet and bittersweet flavors are achieved with rustic layers woven in both fruited and earthy. Moka Kadir has incredibly velvety body too that works very well in milk drinks.</td>\n",

It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our \"dumping ground\" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! Oh, and No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!). New Classic generally involves Brazil as one of the base ingredients, with washed Centrals and South American coffees bolstering sweetness, and of course, chocolate roast tone. Blend ingredients will change with what's in season, but we always shoot for flavor continuity.</td>\n",

Maria Elena's farm, Finca La Salaca, sits at 1750 meters above sea level on the lush mountainous slopes of Zarcero in Costa Rica's famed West Valley growing region. The Pacific is the major influence in the West Valley with sprawling views of Naranjo and Alajuela readily available across it. Finca Salaca is planted with a lot of Villalobos varietal, some Villa Sarchi, and Caturra mixed in. This is a separation of Villa Sarchi, which is a natural mutation of Bourbon known for shorter stature (\"dwarf\"), high yield, and great cup potential - especially when grown at high altitudes. The Monte Brisas mill is incredibly clean and well cared for, and feels a bit like a museum with all of its meticulously maintained older machinery! The coffee is mechanically washed on a Desacafe machine and sun dried on raised beds adjacent to the wet mill. Leaving that fruit mucilage intact instead of washing it away is the hallmark of honey process coffee. This lot, however, is what some call \"semi-washed\", or \"white honey\", which is the Costa Rican equivalent of a fully washed coffee. The demucilager machine is calibrated to remove as much fruit as possible. Then the coffee is soaked for a short period to help wash away some of the remaining fruit. Without fermentation, there is still a very thin layer of fruit intact. This means the coffee looks a little darker when roasting it, and a much higher instance of chaff than the typical fully washed/fermented coffee.</td>\n",

Chinga Factory was the second mill to be developed under Othaya umbrella in 1960. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past two years. We bought three lots from the Chinga station this year alone including this AB lot, one each Peaberry and AA. This coffee's sweetness just blew us away, marked by some lovely fruit hints, and vibrant, bright acidity too. It was purchased direct, not through the Kenya auction system, so we could avoid the risk of losing it. To do this we pay a price that is higher than what the top auction bid might be, but it means we get the exact lot we want.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Coffee and cycling have enjoyed a decades long connection that likely stretches back well before the early days of coffee company-sponsored cycling events (see FAEMA professional cycling team of the late 1960's). Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste!

       "      <td>A longtime favorite espresso blend intended solely for pump and piston type espresso extraction. This is a sweet but punchy little cup, and roasted fairly light it is a shock to the palette, but has great body and a smooth, sweet, stunning aftertaste. The joke behind the name: I imagine a fancy roaster charming a client in the cupping room, effusing about their \"Master Roaster\" and \"Master Blender\" and \"Master Cupper\", all in the trade for decades of course. Then I imagine the scene in their warehouse where hired apes rip open bags of green coffee and randomly hurl handfulls into the hopper for roasting. In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of \"espresso\" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today! Espresso Monkey has become our signature blend for some reason or other, perhaps because it is a true standard that we have sought to maintain for so long, and that we put such nice coffees into it.</td>\n",

So attend to the roaster and stop the roast manually if possible to get it just right. Roast preference with espresso is up to you. I personally prefer the lighter N.

Actually, I like it a lot lighter than that too! I don't like this roasted to a dark, dark roast stage, Full French or Italian. This is because Brazilian coffees become ashy and began to bitter when roasted extremely dark. I believe strongly in a 36+ hour resting period before use for espresso extraction! It wont kill you to use it sooner... but you might notice sharp unpleasant notes.             Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends   \n",

That said, we buy the best visual and cup grade we can and this should not have an affect on flavor.  I advocate a Northern Italian style roast (lighter espresso roast, really a French roast, stopped 30-45 seconds into 2nd crack), but the blend works very well at the darker Southern Italian style roast (a full French roast actually, at the peak of a rapid 2nd crack). Either way, get this into 2nd crack and allow proper resting that espresso demands: 48+ hours is best. This blend works great in air and drum roast machines and I developed it test-roasting on both. If you notice a tingly \"baking soda effect\" in your mouth, then the coffee could use more rest.                        Sweet Maria's Blends   \n",

Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Gahehe sits at just over 1800 meters above sea level and is a collection site for roughly 600 local farmers who are also coop members. As members, they are organized into small groups who receive training in best agricultural practices, seedlings to continue to help increase coffee production, and benefit from access to the global specialty coffee market. Gahahe was built in the mid 1980s, a time when the World Bank was investing heavily in Burundi's coffee sector, building out washing stations like this one to serve the surrounding coffee communities, outfitted with a eco-pulping Penagos for processing coffee cherry. More recently they've come under the direction of a Burundi coffee investment group who are able to offer this coffee, as well as a few others we've purchased (Yandaro, and Kibingo to name a couple), agronomical assistance to station members, regular maintenance of washing station equipment and drying beds, and management teams who follow the coffee deliveries from cherry selection, to keeping lots separated by quality tiers. Since partnering with this group, several of the stations have seen top placement in Burundi coffee competitions, including Gahahe placing 4th in the 2015 Burundi CoE, and 7th the year prior.   \n",

With the fruit intact, dry times increase 3 to 4 fold, taking upwards to a month depending on weather. Dry process coffees tend to be fruit-forward, sometimes even \"winey\" in a slightly fermented flavor, bodied and acidity flattened to some degree. What we have here with Kibingo is a clean example of dry process coffee with a lot of fruit character, never quite reaching the \"ferment\" flavors. Kibingo Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the 18 hills that surround Kibingo. Kibingo sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Kibingo is named after reeds that are growing in the river running alongside the station site, planted in order to help keep the soil at the banks from eroding. They've been around since the mid 1980s, and a couple years back, took 1st place at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small feat.   \n",

The coffee processed at Murambi are from the surrounding hillside villages (\"collines\"), which there's talk of separating in the future, but this year was all blended together by day of delivery. Most of the farms are around 2000 meters above sea level and entirely planted in Bourbon. They mostly produce fully washed coffee using the traditional Kenyan method, but this is a dry process batch, often referred to as \"natural\". Dry processing involves leaving the cherry intact during the entire drying stage, which extends the time it takes to sufficiently dry the coffee to anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. This tends to dim high notes/acidity, as well as impart fruited flavor notes on the cup profile, which can certainly be said about this lot. A few years back the station received a cash premium at the year's end for the coffees they exported, and the mill owner invested in 450 goats that were distributed to as many farmers who work with the station. The program is for the goats to both help with building out an organic farming system, as well as an added source of revenue for the farmers and is still in place today. It is also worth a mention that Murambi won the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition in 2012.   \n",

The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the hills surrounding Masha. The name comes from the Kirundi word \"amasho\" that means \"herds of cattle\". That makes sense seeing that cattle herding just might rival coffee farming in the Masha region! Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Masha coffee washing station (\"CWS\") sits at just under 1700 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. They've been around since 1989, and in 2012 were top placement in Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small task. This is a honey process lot, but the look of the green and bright cup flavors might lead you to think otherwise! Masha roasts easily, very little roast color variance as you move from yellowing, to browning, and onto first crack. It helps that the sort is so good, with little to no trace of underripe coffee in the few hundred grams of coffee that we roasted.   \n",

With the Mubarazi River running through the land, they have good access to water for wet processing, and have implemented a water separation/filtration system to clean dirt and debris from the water before using to process coffee. Agahore is close to the Murambi site, another washing station we buy coffee from, and also managed by the same person. There is much community involvement in managing both sites, actually, and the workers are provided with second payments at the end of each harvest season after all of the coffee is sold, health insurance for workers and their families, and a fertilizer program with free goats. The cultivars planted are mostly Bourbon, and Mibirizi, an older cultivar to the region that likely has Typica genetic roots. We also purchased a dry process lot from Agahore station that will be available very soon.   \n",

Gakenke is named after a plant that grows wild in the area with thin, hollow stems that are commonly used to drink the locally made banana beer. Gakenke pulls clean water from the Rivubo river that runs alongside the station site. During the harvest season 1,900 local coffee farmers from 22 neighboring villages sell their coffee to Gakenke, where it is processed as fully washed and naturally in whole cherry.   \n",

Farmers from surrounding \"collines\", or hill tops, deliver their harvest in whole cherry at the Nemba site, where it is then wet processed and then dried. Kayanza Province itself sits at 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms from the 15 hill tops that serve the Nemba Station top out at over 2000 meters. Farmers grow mostly older bourbon types, the original coffee cultivar introduced to the area in the 1930s by Catholic monks traveling from the island of Reunion. Nemba has been around since the early 1990s, and this year placed top 10 at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small task. Nemba roasts easily, very little roast color variance as you move from yellowing, to browning, and onto first crack. It helps that the sort is so good, with little to no trace of underripe coffee in the few hundred grams of coffee that we roasted.   \n",

For starters, this is West African coffee, not East African like most other arabica offerings such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Rwanda. And a large percentage of Cameroon coffee has traditionally been robusta, grown in all provinces except the north, while arabica is mainly produced in the high altitudes of the west, northwest and east. The western highlands of Cameroon, where much of the coffee is grown, averages about 5,000 feet above sea level and has two distinct seasons, the rainy season and dry season, which benefits quality arabica. This lot is from the Grassfields Cooperative, located in the Bamenda Plateau region. However, this lot is from small holder farms in Kouoptamo, not too far from the mountainous Bamboutos region. The cooperative produces both wet and dry process coffees, and this is the former. They depulp coffee into tanks where it ferments for up to 36 hours to break down the sticky fruit mucilage, which can then be washed away with clean water. Coffee is dried on raised beds for around a week to 10 days. Most of the coffee is grown around 1000 to 1200 meters, and you see a lot of Java and Jamaica varieties planted in Cameroon. I want to mention that found a few lentils/seeds in the 132# jute bag we just opened. It's not all that uncommon in coffee since they often share the same drying patio. Some mills are better than others at getting it out, but it does come with the territory. We removed what we spotted by hand, but expect that one or two may make it through our own screening every now and then. Just give the green beans a scan before roasting. They stand out, and are easy to spot!   \n",

It roughly translates to \"perfection\", and a lot of labor goes into acheiving that status! First, the coffee cherry is floated in water to remove any underripe coffee, which typically floats to the top, while the ripe coffee sinks. Once the coffee is moved to the drying tables it undergoes several more rounds of hand sorting. All of this attention lends to a fairly uniform coffee, especially when you consider it is dry process. The Gerba Doku is run by Gemechu Shonora, along with brothers Shebura, Morkata and Adugna. Their father worked for the local union many years ago as a coffee collector, going out into the surrounding towns buying coffee cherries from farmers. The processing site sits at 2200 meters above sea level, and some of the farms they buy from are even higher elevation! They produce both dry and wet process coffees. Dry process coffees typically dry in sun for 3 days, and then an addition 2+ weeks in the shade. We found the cup expressed relatively clean stone fruit flavors, and reminded me of some of the coffees we buy from cooperatives in the West. It does produce quite a bit of chaff, which is normal for this type of process. Just be aware of it and be sure to vaccuum your roaster between batches, especially for those with open heating elements, like a Behmor.   \n",

The station is Buno Buliye Buliye, and sits at a very high altitude of 2195 meters above sea level. They are process around 1.5 containers of dry process coffee, which believe it or not, is on the small side. It also means these 120 bags are roughly 1/3 of their output last year. These lots are made up of coffee from several hundred different farmers, most with only a couple hundred coffee trees or less. You tend to see coffee intercropped with other fruits and vegetables, \"false banana\" being one the more common food staples to see planted in the Hambela region. Dry processing is the oldest coffee processing method still used, and involves drying the coffee bean and cherry whole. From pictures you see, you might think you can just dump the cherries to the beds and wait. This is not the case, and the best lots take a lot of preparation! The coffee has to be spread out to a layer depth of only a few centimeters, no more, in order to allow air flow. The coffee is turned hourly, or even more frequently, in order to facilitate even drying and keep the coffee from molding. It's not difficult, but requires constant attention. Workers continually pull out lower quality coffee in the form of physical defects and coffee that was not harvested at peak ripeness in order to cultivate Grade 1 quality.   \n",

The processing site sits at 2200 meters above sea level, and some of the farms reach as high as 2350 meters! The high altitude leads to some very small, dense coffee. This lot looks to be as small as 14 screen (measured as 14/64\"), though I did not have any issues with beans finding their way through my Behmor grid drum. They produce both dry and wet process coffees. The dry process method involves drying the whole coffee cherry in the sun, fruit and all. When done with care, it can be complex, fruited, and even aromatic like their washed counterparts. Special attention is given to removing coffee that is not uniformly ripe in order to create their Grade 1 lots. It requires a lot of hand labor, and helps with uniformity in the cup. The coffee dries for 2-3 weeks on raised beds, then stored in a cool warehouse where it rests for at least a month before being prepared for export. The Harsu Wokilo mill is run by Gemechu Shonora, along with brothers Shebura, Morkata and Adugna. Their father worked for the local union many years ago as a coffee collector, going out into the surrounding towns buying coffee cherries from farmers.   \n",

He is the older brother to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. \"Dabaye\" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to be hosted at this station on our December 2018 visit, camping out in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is an incredibly proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and with efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamena, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.   \n",

This region happens to produce some of the most incredible white honey we've tasted in Ethiopia, so the name is particularly fitting! The Kenisa station has registered 305 members since starting up 2 years ago. Initially, they set out on their own but lacked access to getting their coffee to the international market. The Agaro Union is well situated in this respect and is connecting them to a much wider network of buyers (lucky us!). We visited the site last January and the cleanliness and organization were impressive. They employ a water conserving Penagos 2500 to depulp the coffee and the machine looks brand new. We found the coffee from Kenisa to have a stone fruit flavor characteristic common to coffee from this region. Light roasts are delicious and the most vibrant cups. I noticed quite a few latent 'snaps' at the end of 1st crack making degree of roast a bit difficult to judge by sound alone. If you are shooting for a light roast, I would err on the side of caution and pull the roast 1:20 or so after 1st C begins and adjust from there.   \n",

Along with coffee from their own farm called \"Daye Bensa\", they are buying and processing coffee from local farmers from three different growing areas nearby - Shantawene, Bombe and Keramo villages. The samples we tasted from all three sites scored very high and we wound up buying wet and dry process lots from most of them. This lot is a mix of coffees harvested from their own farm and out growers around Bombe village. Ethiopian heirloom cultivars are the main seeds cultivated and altitude ranges from just under 2000 meters to 2100 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that the screen size is on the small side too. The majority of the coffee is 15+, but we are spotting a few 14 screen beans in there too. The biggest concern here is that these smaller, lower density beans will roast faster than the largest coffee. While that can be true, we found that either sticking to City to City+ roast range or slowing down the last leg of the roast helps keep the small beans from charring and darker 'roast' flavors at bay. Behmor users might give their drums a shake after loading the green coffee to allow the tiny beans to fall through before roasting.   \n",

In most cases, this involves depulping the fruit, followed by a fermentation stage that washes away any remaining fruit mucilage, and then drying the coffee on raised beds. At Gikirima, the fruit is removed using a disc-type depulper, common to Kenya. The fermentation stage is typical held to 24 hours, and dry times range from 1 to 2 weeks depending on weather. The washing station sits on the south side of Mount Kenya at 1800 meters above sea level, and farms can reach up to 2000 meters. \"AB\" refers to the size of the coffee bean, in this case 15/64\" to 17/64\". These are the medium sized beans, only trumped by the slightly larger \"AA\". In terms of cup quality, there's not always a discernible difference. That said, the AA screen size always commands a higher price, even when it's not a better tasting coffee! We loved this AB separation from Gikirima, and think you will too.   \n",

Factories are basically what we call a wet mill, or washing station, a local station where farmers bring coffee cherry fruit for processing in Kenya. These Factories are cooperatives made up by local coffee farmers in the surrounding villages, most of which have tiny plots of coffee, less than 1 hectare in size. Ngugu-ini was established in 1958 as part of the Kibirigwi Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"), an umbrella of eight Kirinyaga coops in total, serving more than 7,000 coffee farmers (Ngugu-ini has 1,200 members). The wet mill stands at 1650 meters above sea level, which is a good estimation of median altitude for the farms delivering here. AA, AB and Peaberry separations are made from a single day's harvest, and are merely separations of different bean size range. AA are the largest, and command the highest premiums, but we're never really sure which will shine brightest. In the case of this coffee, we didn't get to taste the AB and Peaberry separations, but were floored by the vibrance and complex matrix of flavor found in this AA.   \n",

Chinga Factory was the second mill to be developed under Othaya umbrella in 1960. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we were well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years. Chinga Peaberry was purchased direct, not through the Kenya auction system, so we could avoid the risk of losing it. To do this we pay a price that is higher than what the top auction bid might be, but it means we get the exact lot we want. This is a \"peaberry\" outturn, which occur when one of the two embryos that typically grown inside a coffee cherry fails to germinate, leaving only one seed to develop and grow into a small, rounded coffee bean. Peaberries can taste a little different than their flat bean counterparts, though not always the case. We picked up the large AA, and medium AB sizes, as well as this single 16 bag lot of peaberries from Chinga Factory.   \n",

The wet mill (called a \"Factory\" in Kenya) is one third of the Gikanga Farmer's Cooperative Society, the other two being Kangocho and Ndaroini (the name \"Gikanda\" is actually made up of the first letters of the three factory names: GIchathaini + KAngocho + NDAroini). They have been an outstanding cooperative for years, and we used to see their coffee with some regularity, but the group we work with in Nyeri hasn't had any offers to show us for a few years. We actually had the opportunity to visit a few years back and hope to again soon. Like most of the region, the farmer members of Gichathaini work very small plots of land. Many have less than one hectare of land, and the preferred cultivars are SL-28, and SL-34 bourbon selections, known for good cup quality, especially when growing conditions are favorable. This region has very good altitude, starting at 1900 meters above sea level, and topping out around 2000.   \n",

The wet mill (called a \"Factory\" in Kenya) operates under the Rugi Farmer's Cooperative Society, an umbrella organization that oversees operations of their associated wet mills, and helps with things like agronomical support to farmers, pre-financing during the harvest season, and marketing the coffees. It's my understanding that Rugi is an older coop, started back in the late 1960's. This is the first year we've tasted there coffee, and feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to pick up this stellar AB lot! Igutha currently has around 600 members delivering their coffee cherry to the mill, and farms are typically 1 hectare or less, and at an altitude range of 1700 - 1900 meters. After depulping the coffee, they employ up to 48 hour fermentation time to beak down the sticky fruit mucilage surrounding the seeds. The coffee is then moved to raised drying beds where it will dry for 2-3 weeks. The preferred cultivars are SL-28, and SL-34 bourbon selections, known for good cup quality, especially when growing conditions are favorable. But you also see Batain, Ruiru 11, quite common in Kenya.   \n",

This is an AB outturn, which means the beans are screened to separate out the coffee bean that measure 15/64 -17/64 of an inch. It's not always a sign of cup quality, but AB, AA and Peaberries are generally given extra care in the dry milling phase.

The Maganjo wet mill is near Mukurwe-ini town in Nyeri, Kenya. It's part of the Rumukia FCS (\"Farmers Cooperative Society\"), and though we've offered coffee from a few others under the Rumukia umbrella, this is the first year we've offered Maganjo coffee. We were offered a few samples in 2021, and settled on this large bean, \"AA\" graded outturn. \"Outturn\" is the name for the separated lots that come from one unmilled lot of coffee. After a coffee is processed and dried, it is moved to the dry mill where it is separated by bean size by running through large vibrating tables and screens. The most common grades you will see on our site are AA (17 to 19/64 inch), AB (15 to 17/64 inch) and Peaberry. We don't always find a correlation between bean size and cup quality, though the AA lots always command the highest price. We bought AA, AB, and Peaberry lots from Maganjo, as they were all incredible in their own way!   \n",

By factory, it does not mean they make mugs, custom hats and vacuum bottles. A \"factory\" is a wet mill where the coop members bring coffee cherry for pulping, fermenting, washing, drying. It's not the factory as we might imagine it. Small washing stations are aligned with a particular \"society\" which is what they call a \"Farmers Cooperative Society\" in Kenya, or simply \"FCS\". This coffee comes from Njuriga Factory, which happens to also be the name of the FCS umbrella. They currently have just under 500 members, most of which are growing coffee on less than 1 hectare of land. Farms in this region tart around 1750 meters above sea level, and tend to be planted in SL-28, SL-34, and Ruiru-11 coffee varieties. We don't want to risk coffees losing a coffee like this in the Kenyan auction system, so we typically pay a premium to ensure the final cost is at or above what the auction price might be in order to secure it. This is the AB outturn, which means the size of the green coffee seeds will fall between a range of 15/64\" and 17/64\".   \n",

Basically this is where members bring coffee cherry for processing - pulping, fermenting, washing, and drying. It's a cooperative setup where these different stations are aligned with farmer members, and the stations belong to a much larger cooperative society: in this case Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society (\"FCS\"). Rukira is one of several member stations, and is comprised of over 500 members delivering coffee cherry to the mill. The Othaya FCS started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Altitude of the washing station is just shy of 1900 meters, and you mostly see SL-28 and SL-34, along with a little Ruiru and Batian cultivars mixed in. Several years back we bought an AB auction lot of Rukira, and we're glad to see it's return. Fruited, bright, sweet, juicy - a real stunner Kenya. This was bought as part of Othaya's own program they call \"Red Cherry\". In short, they pick a few of the farmers who consistently deliver top quality coffee and then work with them to employ an added layer of cherry sorting before the coffee is depulped. This way, they are able to pick out any coffee that is visibly outside the color spectrum that would indicate peak ripeness (hence the name, \"Red Cherry\"!). We generally buy three different outturns from Kenya that are differentiated by bean size; the large AA beans, the medium size AB beans, which this is, and the rounded \"peaberries\". To be clear, all of these different grades are separated from a single lot of coffee, and there's no clear tie to cup quality. Overall, I found this coffee to roast evenly, color quite uniform as you pass a City roast level.   \n",

Thuti is part of the Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), who currently have 18 wet mills under their umbrella, some dating back to the late 1950s. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. The coffees from Othaya Factories have been on our radar for a long time and we've had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past few years. The coffee from Thuti is grown between 1800 and 1900 meters above sea level, and the station serves hundreds of farmer members in the area. The preferred cultivars are SL-28, and SL-34 bourbon selections, known for good cup quality, especially when growing conditions are favorable. But you also see Batain, Ruiru 11, quite common in Kenya.   \n",

It was established in 1965, and membership is currently held in the nearby villages of Karatu, Gitwe, Kibiru and Kigaa Villages. Karatu is a \"factory\", in Kenyan terms, basically a cooperative wet mill that buys and sells the coffee of members. Factories generally supply more than just access to the coffee market, and Karatu offers additional programs including access to capital for farm reinvestment, and provides members with agronomical inputs. The Karatu site sits at around 1890 meters above sea level, and is strategically situated next to the Rwabura river where it is able to pump clean water for processing coffee. They've dug waste water pits where the water used for processing is directed, and soaks into the soil, instead of running off back into the river. This is one of two lots of Karatu we purchased this year, and an AB selection, which refers to the size of the beans (15/64\" to 17/64\"). The other Peaberry outturn is scheduled for early 2024.   \n",

Ben first purchased the land from a man named Taro and they were amongst the first people to cultivate crops in these valleys. In 1965, the government encouraged the early settlers to start growing coffee as a long-term sustainable crop. Ben started to plant coffee trees becoming one of the first coffee producers of the Eastern Highlands The Colbran Family is now in its third generation with Ben's son Nichol and grandson Chris running Baroida plantation. Through either luck or good design, the Baroida plantation sits at the apex of the Lamari river valley and Mount Jabarra range. The plantation itself is at about 1700 meters amongst thousands of hectares of cleared land with former colonial coffee estates surrounding them (now run by native landowners) and flanked by mountains (up to 2300 meters) filled with small holder coffee producers. This is a dry process lot (also referred to as, \"natural\"), where the whole coffee cherry is laid to dry on raised beds until the green seed within reaches a moisture level of around 11%. That tends to take around 30 days. In that time, the cherries ferment, and often impart fruit flavors in the cup. This coffee was fruited in both light and dark roasts, even winey. It also produced a fair amount of chaff when roasting which is something to keep in mind if roasting on a machine with exposed heating elements like the Behmor, or running back to back batches.   \n",

The Colbran Family grows and processes their own coffee from the Baroida Estate, which we sell under that name, as well as buying coffee cherry direct from smallholder farmers in the area. Some of these are communities that the Colbrans have worked with for years, and others walk to the Baroida mill to sell their coffee fruit because they offer a premium price. These farmers can have as few as 100 trees, and produce only handfuls of coffee cherry at a time, but are situated from 1800 up to 2000 meters. I visited this season, and noticed that the price they were paying was higher than what other buyers, including multinational mills, were paying. Many small farms hand-pulp their own coffee, and sell wet parchment. This is not ideal, as the multitude of musty-smelling bags of this coffee attested to.   \n",

Fruit flavors are quieter than some of our other naturals, but still impact the cup. It's worked wonders as espresso too, proving to be just as versatile as its washed counterpart. The washing station Kageyo lies in the highlands surrounding the southeastern shores of Lake Kivu in Rwanda's Ngororero district. It's not too far from another washing we purchase coffee from, Gitesi, and is a coffee that hits a similar quality target. The wet mill recently underwent renovation, expanding their milling infrastructure in order to increase their production capabilities. We helped support this project with our own donations, as well as donating a portion of our Kageyo sales to help see the effort through (so thanks to you too!). The association is made up of small farmers situated around this 2000 meter wet mill, and coffee in the region is some of the highest altitudes we see in all of Rwanda. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee planted in the region is Bourbon variety. It's worth mentioning that this should not be confused with \"Kigeyo\", a name that you may recognize from other cafe menus.   \n",

The coffee washing station serves almost 3000 farmers in the surrounding villages, most with less than 1 hectare of coffee. At just under 1500 meters, the milling site is at a much lower altitude than most of the coffee that comes in, many of the farms reaching above the 1800 meter mark. The station employs many grading techniques to separate out the top quality coffee, starting with the whole coffee cherry being submerged in tanks of water, and removing the low density coffee that floats to the top. The dry process coffee is then moved to raised drying tables where it will dry over the course of a few weeks. During this time, the cherry is turned by hand, and the workers continue to remove any coffee with physical defects they find along the way. All this care and attention results in a very uniform coffee for dry process, making it much easier to roast, as well as a very consistent brew.   \n",

Gitwe sits at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms of the 800 outgrowers who deliver their coffee to Gitwe are situated between 1800 and 2000 meters. This is a fully washed/wet process coffee, meaning that after the coffee cherry is removed from the seed, the remaining sticky fruit layer (mucilage) is removed by fermenting in a tank for several hours. Gitwe has several cement fermentation tanks, and should have no problem moving coffee through to the drying tables during the peak of the harvest. We were a little surprised by how deep the tanks are, and slightly worried that it might affect the coffee during fermentation. But after cupping a handful of samples, we were pleased with the resulting clean cups across the board. This is the peaberry selection, which are the small, nearly perfectly round beans. Peaberries occur when one of the two seeds inside the cherry fails to germinate. The remaining single coffee bean continues to mature, taking on the round shape of the cherry, rather than flattening out on one side. Pretty much every coffee shrub produces a few peaberries, and make up about 3% of the total yield. I roasted Gitwe to light and medium roast levels, and found that Full City roasting flattens out acidity too much for my taste, and mutes complex top notes found at City and City+.   \n",

The wet mill sits at 1770 meters above sea level, and is buying cherry from small holder farmers in the surrounding villages of Nyamagabe. Most farmers have less than 1 hectare of coffee planted in Bourbon, as is largely the case for Rwanda. Kibirizi CWS does many different types of processing, including honey. The honey process involves depulping the outer cherry, but leaving some of the fruit intact to the seed. Unlike the wet process method, the green seeds bypass a fermentation/washing step, going straight to the raised beds to dry. While not always true, honey processing can bring fruit flavors to the cup, which was what we tasted in this coffee. It also produces a high instance of chaff, which is normal for honeys. Just make sure to vacuum your roaster in between batches.   \n",

Not only is it located in a beautiful valley, but the washing station is always so clean, well-organized and the leaders seemed motivated and competent. I had already cupped quite a few day lots (wet-process batches from coffee cherry received in a single day) and I knew the coffee was really good from the previous years we purchased this coffee. The Gitesi site is at 1740 meters, actually one of the lower areas surrounded by high ridges ranging up to 2000 meters where coffee is grown. More than 1,800 coffee farmers in the area supply Gitesi with cherries each year. The station fosters a relationship with the farmers by paying an additional dividend at the end of each season based on performance. Gitesi was started in 2005 and has been building capacity with each passing harvest. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee is Bourbon variety. We \"built\" this lot by looking at all their day lot batches and combining the best ones. We found some excellent process batches from the middle harvest. Gitesi has earned top placement at COE (\"Cup of Excellence\") more than once, and  continues to produce competition level coffees.   \n",

That's a lot of 'Ngororero'! The wet mill are producing mostly fully washed, wet process coffee at this site, but also process a nominal amount of honey and natural process too. Hundreds of farmers in the region deliver their cherry to the site where floatation and hand sorting are first employed in order to begin the grading process. The whole cherry is then run through the de-pulping equipment, fermented in water-filled tanks overnight, then laid to dry on raised African coffee drying beds for upwards 2 weeks. Bourbon is the dominant cultivar in this region and farmers delivering to Ngororero are scattered across an altitude range of 1600 to 2000 meters above sea level. Their coffee is what we often think of as a quintessential Rwandan cup, with impressive sweetness that's spiced in aroma, with ample acidity behind it.   \n",

It is in an ideal area for growing coffee with rich soils, and with so many small holder coffee farmers, it's also a central location for a coffee washing station. The wet mill isits at 1800 meters, with coffee being grown in the area up to 1950 meters. Mutovu Coffee is fairly small compared to many of the other coops and washing stations we buy from, estimated output this year at 2 containers of coffee (roughly 85,000 lbs of milled coffee - twice the amount from when they started). Each farmer supplies their own cherries to the station, as well as collects cherries from their neighbors. We have been buying Mutovu every year since they were established, as well as visiting the coop on every trip to Rwanda we make. Each year we're seeing improvements at the mill, last year's included upgraded milling equipment, new drying beds and a brand new warehouse to better store their parchment coffee. They received CAFE Practices certification too, part of which which means they are separating process batches by day of delivery, a first step in identifying different levels of quality.   \n",

It was being leased by an intermediary we work with in this region for a few years before eventually buying it. Last year was their first year milling their own coffee, and while there were some challenges, they managed to process a nominal amount of coffee. They promoted a station worker from another wet mill to run Nyaco, who showed a strong understanding of operations. It's nice to see that type of promotion happening from within. The mill is situated at 1700 meters bove sea level, and coffee is likely growing as high as 1900 meters. Oh, and Nyaco is pronounced \"Nacho\", which makes it easy for me to remember! This 20 bag lot cupped in line with others we buy from in this region, like nearby Gitwe, for example. It shows well-developed sweetness across a range of roasts, and is moderately complex, bright, when kept to the light side.   \n",

When I first tasted it, the sweetness and bright acidic snap in the cup made a great impression. But at the time I noticed varied quality from one cup to the next, and a lack of consistency can mean problems in the processing. For a coffee buyer, it signifies that what you taste now might not be what you get upon importation. The backstory at the time was Tumba Station was a private processing wet mill that had 2 owners with very different ideas of quality and how to run a mill. Fast forward a few years, and we found ourselves purchasing Tumba for the first time under a very different light. A local teacher in the Tumba area for which the mill is named, had taken over all aspects, and the coffee was consistent in every cup ... and amazingly good! Venustre Mugraneza, the teacher, is esteemed in the local community and has been systematically improving the mill. The best coffee cherries (those that make up this lot) are dried in a special area of raised beds and receive focused handpicking by the farmers. Tumba is situated at 1825 meters in the Rulindo district, where we've also sourced the excellent Cocatu Cooperative lots.   \n",

Topping out around 1900 meters above sea level, Acacia Hills estate is supposedly the highest altitude coffee farm in this region. The estate was established in the 1960's, but coffee has been growing here much longer. Coffee was initially planted here by a group of Germans in the 1930's, a vestige of colonialist settlements in the region. In 2007, the farm was purchased as a joint venture by local Tanzanian coffee farmers, Leon and Aideen Christianakis, and a coffee roaster in Portland, Mark Stell. Since taking ownership, the group has focused on improving the quality through farm renovation, new plantings, soil analysis, and refining the post harvest processes. This is a dry process coffee, which means the seeds are dried with the cherry still intact. This can lead to fruity flavors in the cup, and characteristics like body, and low levels of acidity. This lot displayed lots of rustic fruits in our assessment, and with very nice bittersweetness that makes it well-suited for middle to dark roast levels.   \n",

While they've been around since 1997, they didn't attain cooperative status in 2006, through the help of an NGO. Cooperative members receive assistance, like agronomical support, and are a part of the governing body. At this time, Ilomba only produces fully washed coffee where they see value in the cup quality (and so do we!). Coffee cherry is floated for grade separation before being processed, where unripe coffee floats to the top and is removed. They use a water conserving eco-pulper to remove the outer cherry, and then ferment the coffee for 1-2 days in order to break down the sticky fruit mucilage. The coffee is then washed in channels using clean water, and transported to the raised drying tables, where it takes about 2 weeks to fully dry. The station is at 1700 meters, and coffee is grown up to 1900 meters. Farms are typically less than 2 hectares in size, and farmers are growing Bourbon, Kent, and Typica.   \n",

Why it's not a go-to East African coffee is a complicated question, but it just doesn't grab the same level of attention as neighboring Kenya, (or Burundi and Rwanda for that matter), and it should! Tanzanian coffee can fruited, bright, and just as complex as those in surrounding countries. The coffees of Kanji Lalji are a good example of this. Kanji Lalji is a larger farm owned by a family of the same name, located near Vwawa town in the Igamba district. While our other Tanzania coffees come from smallholders that form cooperative groups, Kanji Lalji is in a different position. The farm has an experienced agronomist, Eliot Swila (photo holding the baby coffee plant), who oversees their unique grafting method to bind the variety called Nylon locally (N39a, a Bourbon type) to drought-resistant Mbozi Compact roots. It's not high-tech in any way, but its beyond the means of the small-holder farmer. And in fact Kanji Lalji does this in a test plot for the government that will ultimately be shared with all farmers if it proves viable to face the seasonal lack of water in the area. All of that is a bit of a fascinating footnote: the lots we selected from Kanji Lalji are from their oldest trees, which are the original Mbozi Mission Bourbon variety. The farm has been managed for decades by Willy, a real character; a 79 year old Swiss expat, sparing in words, but clearly a man with a depth of coffee farming experience that shows in everything he does at Kanji Lalji farm.   \n",

Cooperative members receive assistance, like agronomical support, and are a part of the governing body. The cooperative is still a very small operation, producing fully washed coffee using a small hand-crank depulper, with hopes of reinvesting in new machinery for next harvest. Coffee cherry is floated for grade separation before being processed, where unripe coffee floats to the top and is removed. After depulping the outer cherry, the coffee is fermented for 1-2 days in order to break down the sticky fruit mucilage. The remaining fruit is then washed away in channels using clean water, and transported to the raised drying tables, where it takes about 2 weeks to fully dry. They are buying cherry from several of the surrounding villages that cover an altitude range of 1500 to 1700 meters above sea level. Farms are typically less than 2 hectares in size, and farmers are growing mostly Bourbon types.   \n",

All others were mixed to form \"Sana'ani coffee\" with decidedly mixed outcomes. But coffee in Bani Matari is a bit different, tall old-growth trees that appear like a fruit orchard than a typical coffee farm (well, NO coffee production in Yemen looks like a coffee farm anywhere else!). This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. This lot is made up of coffee from roughly 100 farmers in Bani Matari, who on average have 1000 trees planted on less than 1/2 hectare of land. Altitude is extremely high, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.   \n",
       "48   This year's buying was focused around coffee from four regions, Matari, Sharqui Haraz, Hajjah, and Hiwari, and this peaberry lot is a blend from all four areas. Peaberries occur naturally on every coffee tree, but in very small amount (typically < 5% of the harvest). What happens is, one of two embryos inside the coffee cherry fails to germinate, leaving the other behind to take on a rounded shape as it matures. They tend to be separated out from the regular \"flats\" during the dry milling process where coffee is separated by size using large mechanized screen sorters. At the end of our buying, Fatoum Muslot, who oversees operations at this source, asked us if we wanted to buy the peaberries that were separated out from each of the lots we purchased. What that means is, this peaberry lot is the same coffee as the others on our site, just the small peaberry beans that were sorted out from the rest. That fact really makes it an interesting counterpoint to any of the others we have. This lot was secured through Fatoum, who took over the Pearl of Tehama export business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality.

Altitude is extremely high in these areas, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. This It's been a few years now since we've picked up Yemeni coffee, not necessarily by choice, but mainly due to the difficulties exporting from a country at war. The situation there is still quite dire, and I'm amazed that anything is making it out of the country. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.   \n",

If you travel west on the road from the capital Sana'a, toward Hodeidah on the Red Sea, you will pass quite close to Haraz, as I did when traveling to Yemen a several years back. I visited an amazing zone within Haraz with towering, ancient stone villages, like castles precariously perched atop steep precipice. It was incredibly dramatic. All the coffee here is grown on terraces, since little land exists that is flat, except for the lowland deserts. The coffee is hauled up remarkably steep slopes, carried in small amounts, most often by donkey. This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the operations, she has worked to implement quality-focused practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. Roughly 140 farmers are contributing to this regional blend, nd the altitude of the farms hover around 2200 meters above sea level. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, and shipping in Ecotact has really helped with the long transit times from Yemen.

But much of the coffee is grown at relatively low altitudes and poorly processed and prepared. There is a lot of regular commercial grade India Arabica. Even when well done, the coffees can be \"softish\" physically and in flavor. Soft coffees from low altitudes are more difficult to roast (especially in small home roasters I believe). The result can be ashy flavors, and greater risk of scorching or tipping the coffee. That's why I have been very impressed with this new crop arrival of Pearl Mountain Peaberry. This coffee plantation was planted in 1920 by Shivappaiya Patre, who cultivated the estate and called it Ratnagiri which when translated to English means Pearl Mountain. This estate has now been passed on to the 3rd generation of Estate owners, Rohith and Ashok Patre. The coffee is planted between 1200 and 1500 meters in a zone of the Western Ghat mountains that gets consistently heavy rainfall. The coffee on the farm is interplanted with pepper vines (which are grown on the canopy of large shade trees) and cardamom groves. The Patre family is extremely quality conscious. The coffee is grown under shade trees midst pepper vines and cardamom groves. The carefully picked cherries are sorted prior to pulping, fermented between 42 and 72 hours and hand-washed in water from clear mountain streams. The mild vibrance and clean cup taste really sets this Indian Arabica coffee apart from the mirky, unclean flavors we find often in India wet-process coffees, which are generally more commercial-level coffees.   \n",

Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste!

Beneficio Cerro Alto was one of the earliest micro-mills to be erected in the early 2000's, and has since achieved carbon neutral certification. While they produce full honey and natural process coffees too, this is a \"white honey\" process that is the standard in Costa Rica, and their version of a \"fully washed\" coffee. The biggest difference between traditional wet processing and white honey is that the coffee is not fermented to remove the mucilage. The coffee is processed in a mechanical demucilager which are capable of removing most of the sticky fruit mucilage without a fermentation step. The coffee is still soaked in clean water and then agitated for cleaning, but there is a very thin layer of fruit still intact during the drying phase. This type of process tends to produce the more vibrant, clean Costa Rican coffees, though they still shed a lot more chaff than you're average wet process coffee during roasting.   \n",

The Guardia family have farmed coffee here for more than 100 years, historically selling their harvest to large mills, as was the norm. That all changed in the late 90's with the micro-mill revolution that swept Costa Rica, and, seeing value in controlling their coffee quality through to export, the family erected their own small milling operation at their farm. Currently under the management of Diego Guardia, the farm have decided to move away from more water intensive process methods, favoring honey and dry process instead. This 18 bag lot is considered a \"yellow honey\", in that roughly 50% of the fruit mucilage is left intact after depulping, and isn't removed until after the coffee is fully dried (to 10-11% moisture). This process method can impact the cup flavors and physical characteristics too. In the case of this coffee, it possesses fruit and wine-like notes, big body, no doubt tied to process method. The beans also look a little darker when roasting, and produce more chaff, both due to the fact that the seeds have more silver skin than a fully washed, wet process coffee. Hacienda Sonora sits at 1300 meters above sea level, and is planted in a variety of cultivars, including this \"Centroamericano\" separation, which is a first generation hybrid with some resistance to leaf rust. We also purchased a fully natural (dry process) lot from Sonora that comes later in the year.   \n",

They focus on organic production, and while coffee is central, their work goes beyond that. They provide technical assistance to farmers, and establish community-based programs that support primary education, and address issues like gender equity, and food scarcity. This particular dry process lot is from farmers in the indigenous Mayan region of Quiche (\"K'iche' \"), one of the most densely populated Departments in Guatemala. Much of the coffee growing areas are settled along the Chuacús mountain range that runs from El Quiche to Baja Verapaz, and farms for this coffee range from 1600 to 1700 meters above sea level. A few years back the cooperative built a wet mill and processing site in the town of Joyabaj, centralizing the cherry collection from surrounding villages, and allowing for greater quality control. This is a dry process coffee, meaning the whole coffee cherries are dried with green seeds still inside. It takes a lot longer to dry whole cherry than the wet process method, which can lead to fruity flavors, body, and lower acidity, which is what we found in this coffee. This lot also holds Fair Trade and Organic certifications.   \n",

You may recognize his name associated with his other farms, \"Finca La Esperanza\" and \"Finca El Regalito\". Both farms are renowned for producing exceptional quality coffees, and have been recognized by many an international jury, and roasters around the world. It's also a well-known fact that Aurelio is one of the kindest, gentlest souls you'll ever meet, which certainly helps sweeten the deal! Punta del Cerro sits at an altitude of 1750 meters above sea level near Peña Roja town in La Libertad, and is planted in Bourbon and Caturra coffee cultivars. Aurelio's family have deep coffee roots in the region and have built a network that extends well beyond the extended family. They act as representatives of smallholder coffee farmers in the region, to some extent, assisting with post-harvest processing, and working closely with international buyers who pay premium prices for high quality coffee. He and his brother Aler recently erected a wet mill in Injerto town that is set up to handle a fairly high volume of coffee during the harvest peak. They are set up with plenty of outdoor patio space, as well as an indoor drying room that at the moment is reserved for natural and honey process coffees.   \n",

The road to the coffee producing area of Patzún is a beautiful one as, after climbing well above 2,000 meters above sea level, you slowly descend from the yellows and browns of corn growing country into a rather small, heavily shaded canyon which is home to this coffee. This area is one of the most well shaded that I've seen in Central America. The coffee trees are protected under an excellent canopy. Another unique aspect of this region is the heavy dose Typica varietals we've found planted among the Bourbon and Caturra. This most definitely lends to the also unique flavor profile we find in Patzún. Processing here is fairly standard as far as Guatemala is considered. After depulping the coffee beans are fermented up to 24 hours, washed in long channels and sun-dried on patios.   \n",

Specifically, this small lot is a blend of coffees from six small producers in the growing areas of Santa Barbara, Cuilco, La Libertad and San Pedro Necta. In the past, small coffee producers in this area had few options when selling their coffee locally; they could take it to the large mills down at lower elevations and get paid the going rate, or they could sell it to \"coyotes\" who drive the dirt roads in their trucks paying cash for coffee. Neither offered any extra price for quality, even though the coffees were grown higher and tended with greater care than the big farms down at lower elevations. We partnered with local coffee people to offer higher prices if the farmers could meet our quality expectations in the cup, and this lot is testament to that success. Given that the localities where we are buying coffee are little more than extended family groups, we have found if we involve a brother or sister, they will tell all their coffee-farming kin and soon we have a network of farmers interested in our project. We wrote an in-depth and detailed description of the project as well.   \n",

The San Pedro growing region is perched high in the mountainous Huehuetenango, where farm altitude ranges from 1800 - 2000 meters above sea level. This coffee comes to us through a joint-effort between us and a San Pedro Necta micro-mill owner who, through the years, has introduced us to neighbors in his village, as well as in many of the surrounding townships nearby. He and his wife run an export business in Huehuetenango town, and have set up a really nice coffee lab where they roast and cup coffees, and ultimately separate out the different quality tiers together. It's always such a pleasure to visit and cup with them! It helps us greatly to enlist local support, folks who not only know the land but also the local farmers. We put in quite a bit of work ourselves, tasting many rounds of samples in order to identify the premium-level coffees, as well as make several trips to the area each year meeting with farmers and collecting information. This is part of our \"Proyecto Xinabajul\" in Huehuetenango, which you can read an in-depth and detailed description of the HERE.   \n",

The farms where this coffee was sourced sit right around 1700 meters and are planted mostly in Caturra types. This is an area of small holders, not estates like you'd see in the lowlands. The topography wouldn't allow for sprawling farms as the hillside is jutting, and where instead small hamlets are situated in the lands carved out in the surrounding hillside that is sprinkled with countless tiny farms at a couple hectares each. Pulping and fermentation of the coffee is handled locally, and the coffee is, for the most part, patio-dried. Dry-milling happens at a mill in Huehuetenango town where they are equipped with state of the art equipment, and with the infrastructure to properly handle small lots of coffee. \"Xinabajul\" is the name of the project/partnership we have with local coffee people to offer higher prices to farmers that meet our quality expectations in the cup.

First, it was his grandfather's land that he and his father tended. That land was passed on to his father when he was in his teens, and now in his early 20's, Juan Carlos has 1 hectare of coffee to call his own. His farm is called \"Los Pimientas\", and is located in Las Flores, Santa Barbara, at roughly 1300 meters above sea level. Being a security guard at the nearby San Vicente mill, Juan Carlos witnessed how other coffee farmers were benefitting from investing in their farms, specific cultivars, and changing their harvest and post-harvest practices. Seeing how others were gaining a clear return on a structured farming approach, Juan Carlos decided to follow suit. With the help and guidance of the San Vicente team, he started experimenting with different process techniques, and planted his farm with 75% Parainema, and 25% Gesha. This is a dry process version of his Parainema coffee. Parainema is a type of Sarchimor (Sarchimor = cross between Villa Sarchi and Timor Hybrid) that was originally produced in Costa Rica, and introduced in Honduras within the last decade. The name \"Parainema\" came about in the growing area of Paraiso, on Honduras' Southeastern border. The name itself is a hybrid of Paraiso and nematode (\"Parai\" + \"nema\"), of which the cultivar is resistant to. Grown in higher altitudes, Parainema is known to exhibit unique aromatic and herbal qualities, which is what we were looking for when cup testing several cultivar separations.   \n",

Esteban is the second generation to farm coffee here, following in the footsteps of his father, Constantino Madrid. Their farm sits adjacent to their home, at roughly 1550 meters above sea level. Initially planted in Bourbon, Esteban and Leonela have replanted half the farm in Parainema, and Pacas (this lot looks like a mix of the two varieties). This coffee was milled at Beneficio San Vicente, where it underwent a fermentation for a day before washing away the fruit mucilage and drying under cover for about two weeks. Beneficio San Vicente are one of Honduras' earliest champions as a specialty coffee origin rather than volume-oriented. They've worked tirelessly over the last 20 years to further this mission, reaching out to small producers in the surrounding regions to improve the coffee quality, and ultimately, the price paid for their coffees.   \n",

He acquired his own small, 1.75 hectare parcel about a decade ago, and redeveloped the land with all new plantings of Pacas (natural mutation of Bourbon that's prized for its smaller stature, and good cup quality). After initially selling to the commercial market, Alexis was introduced to Beneficio San Vicente, who helped him agronomical support, and connecting him with the international Specialty market. His coffee is wet processed, but with a long, 32 hour fermentation. I'd venture that the extended fermentation time is responsible for some of the fruit flavors we picked up on, a welcome addition to an otherwise bittersweet cup. Alexis's farm is called \"El Zancudal\", and sits at 1500 meters above sea level just outside the village of El Sauce, Santa Barbara Department.   \n",

Unfortunately, a coffee leaf rust outbreak about a decade later wiped out much of coffee in the area, nearly decimating the once lucrative coffee production as well. Undeterred, families replanted their farms, this time diversifying the coffee cultivars with disease-resistant hybrids, but also keeping any healthy Pacas/Typica that remained. Within a few years, the initial new plantings produced their first real harvest, revitalizing the coffee community in Cabañas. It was during the time of replanting that 3 farmers joined together to build a small wet mill and drying station, where local farmers could process their harvest down to the green coffee. The idea was to give community members a more direct link in the supply chain, not to mention, the opportunity to control quality from coffee cherry, all the way down to the dried green coffee in parchment. This lot is made up of coffees from 20 farmers in the town of Los Planes, within the Municipality of Cabañas. A little more than half of the coffee trees grown here are disease-resistant hybrids such as Lempira, and Ihcafe, along with the original Pacas, and Catuaí (cross of Mundo Novo, and Caturra). Most of the farms are about 2.5 hectares in size, and situated at an average altitude of 1650 meters above sea level. This coffee was purchased through Beneficio San Vicente, who also manage the dry milling and exportation. It's worth noting that the green looks rustic, and a little more like a honey processed than washed, even though it is the latter. We spotted several secondary defects, like insect damage, unripe coffee, and chipped beans. We did not pick any of these out from the coffee we roasted for review. See photo.   \n",

Shortly after, Edwin's neighbor told him of a new varietal produced in Honduras called \"Parainema\". The name itself is a hybrid of Paraiso and nematode (\"Parai\" + \"nema\"), of which the cultivar is resistant to. Perhaps just as important, it's known for producing a good cup, which Edwin's neighbor could attest to having won the Cup of Excellence competition in Honduras that year. Edwin planted his 1/2 hectare in this variety and the rest is history. Edwin and his wife Jenny have since expanded their farm (\"El Plan\") to 2 hectares, 1/2 of which is planted in Parainema. Their 1400 meter farm is located in Las Flores village, within the Santa Barbara department. The family has been working with Beneficio San Vicente to improve their harvest/post-harvest practices, as well as to access a greater segment of the Specialty Coffee market.   \n",

The only hybrid he has chosen to plant is Parainema, identified by its elongated seeds, and known for producing high cup quality. His coffee is milled and exported by Beneficio San Vicente, arguably one of the first exporters to promote single-farmer, micro-lot coffees in Honduras, rather than taking a volume-oriented approach.

The Maracaturra cultivar is a large bean variety of coffee, a cross between Caturra and the so-called \"Elephant Bean\", Maragogype. It seems to be grown mostly in Nicaragua although I have found nice examples in El Salvador too. Buenos Aires is a rather low farm compared to other origins we buy, with this lot coming from about 1200 meters. This coffee is wet processed, which means that the whole cherry is mechanically separated from the coffee seed, and then the sticky layer of mucilage is broken down and removed using overnight wet fermentation. This tends to produce higher acidity levels, and often a cleaner, more clear set of cup flavors all around. Maracturra can be tricky to roast due to the enormous bean size requiring a little extra time to develop the inside of the bean. If you have the ability to control heat on your roaster, try a \"slow and low\" approach, slightly extending the beginning roast leg before 1st crack in order to produce a little more roast consistency from the inside out.   \n",

Finca San Salvador came under his direction and ownership about 4 years ago now, thriving from his expertise and leadership and actually placed top 30 a couple years back at the Nicaraguan Cup of Excellence competition. It is located in the Dipilto area, in an area with a pleasant microclimate, with ample sun for drying coffee. They mechanically wash the coffee using a Penagos depulper that removes the coffee cherry and mucilage layer in one pass, not relying on fermentation to break down the sticky fruit. The coffee is then soaked in tanks overnight with fresh water to further clean the seed before washing in long cement channels where any remaining fruit is removed by agitating the coffee with long wooden paddles as it moves to the end. The coffee is transported from the beneficio to Buenos Aires dry mill in Ocotal where it is dried and prepared for export.   \n",

But when I hear \"Java\" (or Gesha for that matter!), my ears perk up a bit. This unique cultivar came to Central America by way of Cameroon, through transfer and cultivation on the isle of Java. It resembles some Ethiopian heirlooms in physical appearance, and also tends to produce aromatic cup when roasted light. In a word, it's interesting! Most farms we buy Java from only grow a small amount. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to come across this uncharacteristically large lot from Los Altiplanos, who've gone all in with this unique cultivar. Their 78 hectare farm has a large portion of the farm devoted to Java, and this lot we selected was a whopping 49 bags! The Los Altiplanos farm is owned and managed by Ricardo Cuadra, whose family have been growing coffee in this region for more than 100 years. His farm is located near Jinotega, near the mountain reserve of Datanli el Diablo, with altitudes reaching upwards of 1300 meters. We have not visited Ricardo's farm, but hope to next harvest.   \n",

This 150 hectare farm and processing site is owned and operated by Mesfin Dabessa and his family. They are producing both dry process and fully washed coffees, having erected a washing station onsite back in 2015. This lot is a dry process coffee, where the whole cherry is laid to dry on raised beds and not removed until both fruit and seed (green \"bean\") are down to 10-11% moisture. We've found that adding fruitier naturals to the equation helps lock in some of what we think of as Ethiopian origin characteristics, which is what we've done here. Wolenso Dabessa was acquired as part of a land grant by the government in 2008, where large areas of semi-forested area were given to farmers with the idea that planting coffee while preserving the natural forest canopy would be an improvement toward sustainability. While this is where Dabessa got his start, his father's history growing coffee in the region dates back to 1946. Dabessa's washing station happens to be on the site of his original farm. The farm and mill sit at around 1800 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown up to 2000. Check out the video tour we put together of Wolenso Dabessa HERE. We sent a chunk of this coffee off for decaffeination at Swiss Water Coffee in Vancouver, BC. and are thrilled with the results. The Swiss decaf method is one of the gentler processes, using only water to remove 99.9% of the decaf, and leaving some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact.   \n",

While it was originally a bit more limited in which islands were included, it is now commonly used to refer to the entire chain of Indonesian islands. We are using this name for a blend of Indonesian coffees we sourced, reserving small quantities of each for a custom Swiss Water decaf. This lot of Nusantara includes wet hulled coffee from the islands of Timor Leste, a typical body/bittersweet blend component that comes through loud and clear in decaf! In addition, we've added a really interesting \"honey labu\" processed Sumatran coffee, a hybrid honey-wet hulled processing technic that we started seeing in Aceh a few years back. Both coffees were grown around 1500 meters above sea level. The honey labu coffees we've purchased have tasted more in line with sweet, and sometimes fruited, honey process coffees, rather than herbal, earthy wet hulled. Together, they construct a chocolate-laden, big bodied, decaf, that is best roasted in the middle, City+ to Full City+ roast range. This is where it shows peak chocolate characteristics while retaining a nicely developed sweetness to balance the cup. Fantastic dual-use decaf that also makes a great base blending ingredient. Try 1:1 with Ethiopia Gera Goma SWP Decaf (click here for Coffee Shrub) for a Moka Java blend. This decaf was processed at the Swiss Water Decaf plant where their patented chemical-free, decaffeination process is employed using only water to remove 99.9% of the caffeine content.   \n",

Farmers sell their coffee in whole cherry to local milling stations where the coffee is then processed, in this case the Gatare wet mill, and Kanyege cooperative. This lot was initially wet processed before sending off to be decaffeinated. \"Milles Collines\", as Rwanda is commonly referred to, translates to \"the land of 1000 hills\" in French. The cooperatives and washing stations who contributed to this blend are situated in the villages at the tops of some of these \"collines\", affording access to the higher elevation coffees, and offering ease of delivery for these coffee farm members. Most farms in this area are situated between 1500 and 2000 meters above sea level. This is 100% Bourbon cultivar, which when grown at high altitudes produces a dense bean capable of producing a high level of sweetness. The decaffeination was handled by Swiss Water Decaf in Vancouver, BC (where we have all our decafs processed). Their chemical-free decaffeination process removes 99.9% of the caffeine, while leaving much of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. That means the tasty coffees we send off for decafffeination are returned with much of their original appeal. Read more about the Swiss Water Decaf process here.   \n",

With a full list of coffees from Indonesia and Ethiopia, the timing for this blend was right to blend a fruity dry process Ethiopia and earthy wet-huleled Sumatra, decaffeinated at the Swiss Water Process (\"SWP\") plant in Vancouver, BC. The goal of the blend was to produce a Moka Java version that showed big body, brooding bittersweetness when roasted dark, and with some dark fruit accent notes that can be tempered (or not) with roast development. The coffees that went into this blend really hit the mark. The \"original\" Moka Java was comprised of two of the earliest coffees to be exported from Yemen and Java, hence the name. I can honestly say, it's a resounding success and is hard to pinpoint as 'decaf' coffee at all! (It's worth noting that the high score should be taken in context of other decafs). This is an incredibly forgiving blend where bittersweetness is a prominent feature at a very wide range of roast levels.   \n",

It's the decaf version of our popular Altiplano blend, that we keep in stock most of the year. Like Altiplano, this blend is put together with balance in mind, choosing coffees that are fresh, offer sweetness and moderate acidity, and are capable of dense chocolate roast flavors when roasted dark. We favor coffees that work well as brewed coffee and espresso, and that show well at a variety of roast levels, so that we get a decaf that hits those same marks. Swiss Water decaf in Vancouver BC are a key ingredient in that last part. Their patented chemical-free water process method is one of the gentler methods out there, and we've found that the coffees we have processed by Swiss come back tasting great. All decaffeination methods impact flavor to some extent, but the Swiss process seems to leaves some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Send off a fruity coffee, get a fruity decaf in return. Or in this case, a sweet decaf with balanced low tones and modest acidity!   \n",

It's a good example of how processing can make a big impact on flavor. The first stage of processing involves first sealing the whole coffee cherry in barrels for 3 days, where an anaerobic fermentation starts in the airtight tanks. They they depulp the outer cherry, unlike the wet process method, where the sticky fruit mucilage is removed with fermentation, the coffee is dried with the fruit layer still intact. The coffee has a lot more silverskin than washed, and produces a lot more chaff during roasting. I'd advise vacuuming out your machine between roasts. The farms where this coffee is from are in close proximity to the Wawo Muda volcano on Flores island, benefiting from the nutrient rich soil in this high altitude zone (1500+ meters above sea level). Farmers in this area tend to grow a mix of older Typica trees and S795, commonly referred to as \"Jember\", a natural mutation of Typica and Liberica. Coffee is typically traded through cooperatives or coffee \"collectors\", this being the latter. It's from a few different collectors who gather from farmer groups in nearby areas such as Wolo Bobo, and Bajawa, all of it processed at a central station called Wawo Wae.   \n",

We traveled with Albert a few years back, which at that time, we bought his coffee under the name \"Wawo Muda\", which you may remember. Now he and his partner Reti have their own coffee site near Bajawa town where they are processing coffee down to dried parchment. The soil is rich in nutrients, and they are able to grow coffee using fully organic farm practices, though they are not certified at this time. This is a wet process coffee, and some might be surprised to find that it fits right in next to a lot of our wet process Central American coffees. That is to say, it has well-balanced bittersweetness, and acidity, and isn't earthy or rustic like a typical wet hulled Indonesian coffee. The coffee in this region is grown between altitudes of 1350 and 1550 meters above sea level.   \n",

Farmers in this area tend to grow a mix of older Typica trees and S795, commonly referred to as \"Jember\", a natural mutation of Typica and Liberica. Coffee is typically traded through cooperatives or coffee \"collectors\", this being the latter. It's from three different collectors who gather from farmer groups in nearby areas such as Wolo Bobo, and Bajawa, all of it processed at a central station called Wawo Wae. Unlike many of our wet process Floresian coffees, this wet hulled lot shares many similarities in the cup with rustic Sumatran coffee. When roasted dark, it produced brooding low tones and earthy sweetness, low acidity, and big body. If you're a fan of wet hulled coffees, Wawo Wae will fit right into your rotation.   \n",
       "79                            Monsooned coffees are stored in special warehouses until the Monsoon season comes around. The sides of the structure are opened and moist monsoon winds circulate around the coffee making it swell in size and take on a mellowed but aggressive flavor. This Monsooned Malabar is sourced from several farms in Southern India. Typically, the coffee is naturally processed, then spread on the floor of the special monsooning warehouse, raked and turned around by hand to enable them to soak in moisture of the humid winds. The monsooning process takes around 12 to 16 months of duration, where in the beans swell to twice their original size and turn a pale golden color. Then they do additional rounds of hand sorting to remove any coffee that did not expand properly, and the coffee is prepared for export. This is an extremely pungent cup with a unique combination of burnt-bittering flavors, caramel finish and potent earthy aspects. It is not for those who like a \"clean\" cup, or sweet coffees! By all standard definitions, this is a defective set of cup flavors, though still quite interesting, unique, and not to mention, useful. (It's been a key component in our Liquid Amber espresso blend since the beginning!) Monsooned Malabar gets a free pass from the coffee censors because of cultural tradition, history, and the fact that (while it doesn't conform to the traditional ideas of good coffee) it is in it's own right a unique coffee flavor. It has some use in espresso blending with a preparation of longer drum roasting and resting (after roasting) of 3+ days. There are Italian espresso roasting companies that use this coffee in their \"exotic\" blend offering, along with 2-3 other non-monsooned arabicas to even out the cup and provide aroma and some sweetness. Even as a drip/infusion brew, the coffee mellows after 2 days and the cup is more balanced so resting is key to best cup results. Please see the physical appearance of the coffee in that first photo, as it can be quite a shock if you've never seen Monsoon coffee before! It's pale white, slightly 'speckled'. We do our best to find the best quality all around, and think this is one of the cleanest looking lot we've seen in a long time!   \n",

Two of them may be familiar names by now, since we've carried their coffees individually on our site, Haji Iyan, and Pak Gunawan. Whereas many collectors create large blends of all the coffee they buy, Iyan and Gunawan pay special attention to separating by region, these smaller lot sizes adding a layer of quality control, not to mention more specific provenance. Most of the coffee in this lot is from around the villages of Tambak Ruyung, Patuha, and Indragiri. Farms span an altitude range of 1500 to 1800 meters, and typical varieties grown are Ateng types like Sigarar Uteng, and older Typicas. This is a fully washed coffee, which is pretty common in Java. The cup flavors come off very clean, and well-balanced, and in many ways, not unlike a clean washed Central American coffee.   \n",

It comes from a collector in this area who is buying coffee from the villages of Cipelah, Cianjur, Rancabali, and a few others. \"Collectors\" are intermediaries of sorts who buy partially processed coffee and full coffee cherry from small scale farmers and then often process the coffee down to the dried seed/bean. This particular collector built their own washing station last season, which opens up greater quality control than others who are only buying \"gabbah\", or wet coffee processed by the farmers they buy from. This region tends to hit its harvest peak earlier than many others, even though farms are relatively high elevation (1300 to 1500 meters). I don't know how much the timing of the harvest has to do with it, but the wet hulled lots from this region also seem to cup consistently high!   \n",

Daen Balenkang and his family operate a small farm and coffee processing site in Topidi, buying coffee from neighbors, as well as milling the coffee from his own farm. Daeng first started coffee farming 50 years ago, planting a small amount of Typica near his home (apparently only 7 seedlings, a very small amount!). Since then, he's gone from selling to traders to becoming a trader himself, becoming somewhat of a representative for the coffee of his village. Most of the surrounding farms are planted in Typica (thanks to those original 7 seeds), and the locals look to Daen and his family for a more direct connection to the global market where they receive a better price for their coffee. Daen does different types of processes, this being a traditional dry process (\"natural\") lot, exemplary of the more fruit-forward cup that comes from this process method. There's approximately 2000 hectares of coffee planted in the villages that surround Topidi, with an altitude range of 1300 to 1500 meters above sea level. It's worth noting that while they are not certified, organic coffee farming is the default in this area.   \n",

Farms in these regions tend to span an altitude range from about 1300 to 1600 meters and are planted in older, long berry types (you'll see the long, canoe shaped beans) Abysinnia, Ateng and Tim Tim. In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs. This coffee is an anaerobic-wet hulled coffee, a hybrid of sorts that constructs incredibly complex cup flavors. The first step of this hybrid coffee process involves storing the whole cherry in a sealed environment, which is where the name \"anaerobic\" comes from (though not entirely correct, since there is still oxygen inside the barrels or bags used). While the cherry is fermenting in this closed system, the CO2 that is created during the process builds into a high pressure environment, that supposedly allows for a more controlled fermentation process. One thing's for sure, most of the anaerobic fermented coffees we've tried skew toward outlier fruit flavors, winey in character, and with lower acidity. This seems to be the case here, though tempered by the wet hulled/giling basah step that follows. The cherry and fruit are peeled straight from the fermentation tanks, and then dried the rest of the way on raised beds. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region. But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup of fruit and foresty flavors, big body, low toned, and complex through and through.   \n",

The cooperative serves about 450 farmers in the area who are divided into 24 farmer groups, 4 of which are specifically women's farmer groups. Many of the farms in this area are planted in older Typica types and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level. This is a wet hulled coffee, also known as \"giling basah\". This is the typical process method in Sumatra and involves removing the parchment layer while the coffee is still wet, exposing it to the elements well before the coffee is stable. When handled well during the drying phase (like this coffee), this rustic process method yields an earth-toned, bodied cup, with mild acidity and syrupy sweetness, and the green bean taking on a dark green hue unlike wet or dry process coffees from other producing countries. Having roasted this coffee, I'm very pleased with the uniformity of roast color and the minimal quakers from underripe coffee making it through. Giling basah - and Sumatran coffee in general - has a reputation for being riddled with defects even at \"Grade 1\" standard. Our \"Appearance\" category score is a little on the high side as a sort of worse case scenario, even though the green I inspected looked much cleaner than this. I saw minimal broca damage for Sumatra (this is not a Latin American coffee), only a few unripe beans, and some broken beans. It's no Grade 1 Ethiopian coffee, but far better than your average Grade 1 Sumatra.   \n",

The biggest difference with this year's coffee is that the farmers are delivering whole coffee cherry to a central processing station instead of managing the wet processing individually at home. The cherry collection and new wet mill where the coffee is handled is run by the same Farmpro group who we've bought Timor Leste coffee from the last few years, and they only continue to refine their process. The Daurfusu wet mill is located in Dukurai village, Letefoho District. Initially comprised of 37 members in Dukurai, the operation has cast a wider net this year and is buying coffee from neighboring high altitude zones as well. Farmers in this area are growing a mix of cultivars, mostly Timor Hybrid and Typica, at altitudes of 1400 to 1600 meters above sea level. This is a dry process coffee, meaning the whole coffee cherry is laid to dry without any removal of the fruit. The dry times are quite long with all that wet, organic mass, usually upwards of 3-4 weeks time. The fermentation that occurs inside the cherry often leads to a fruity cup profile, bigger body, and muted acidity. The results can be wildly different than a wet processed batch from the same farm or station! It's a unique opportunity to taste just how profound an impact processing can have on the final cup profile.   \n",

The main difference here, is that each individual farmer in Hateletegeo are processing their own cherry down to dried parchment before delivering to Daurfusu, rather than selling as whole cherry. In one sense, the coffees are processed in a less uniform way, each by a different individual farmer. But the differences in technique from one farmer to the next also lends to difference, and interest, and can heighten cup complexity. The village of Taurema is located in Eraulo, Letefoho, and at 1900 to 2000 meters above sea level, it's the highest region we are buying from. The Hatletegeo group is made up of around a dozen farmers, totaling roughly 100 hectares of land between them, though much of that is devoted to vegetables. Hatletegeo is a versatile coffee that proved to function well at medium-to-dark roast levels, and as both brewed coffee and espresso. I don't normally take cream with my coffee, but was surprised to find that I really enjoyed Taurema with a splash of milk, and even some ice on a hot day!   \n",

The group consists of 10 members who ae delivering whole coffee cherry to a central processing station called Daurfusu. The cherry collection and new wet mill where the coffee is handled is run by the same Farmpro group who we've bought Timor Leste coffee from the last few years, and they only continue to refine their process. Farmers in this area are growing a mix of cultivars, mostly Timor Hybrid and Typica, and in the case of Sabelu, at altitudes of 1500 to 1600 meters above sea level. The arrival of washed Timor Leste coffees comes at a time when Central American options are starting to thin out, and in terms of flavor, they work quite well as replacement! But they also just shine on their own, offering a flavor profile that's uniquely positioned within the coffee producing regions of Southeast Asia and Indonesia.   \n",

Her story is not all that uncommon. Viviana comes from a family of coffee farmers, and after reaching adulthood and acquiring a small piece of land from her grandfather, she decided to take the plunge herself. What's unique about Viviana's farm, and the Bahia region in general, is that there is a culture of small scale farming. I know we've called 50 hectare Brazilian estates \"small\" in some of our reviews, because in Brazil, that is considered small. But Viviana's 7 hectare farm is small on a global scale. Saco de Onca is situated on a sloping hillside, with shade trees interspersed. She is growing Catuaí, a cross between Mundo Novo and Caturra that is known for its high production yield, and short stature making it easy to pick. The latter is particularly helpful on a farm that employs selective hand harvesting. We have not visited Viviana, and I'm hoping to learn more about her processing methods next season. Her coffee is fruit forward in a way that is pretty unusual for Brazilian coffee. When cupping the offer sample, we noted it's wilder cup character, which we enjoyed, but we were unsure which way the fruit would go. I'm happy to report the cup is tasting sweet as ever, and the fruits provided an interesting flavor backdrop in both our City and Full City roasts.   \n",

The farm is owned by Francisco Isidro Dias Pereira who has 75 hectares dedicated to coffee with a total size of 215 hectares of land. Santa Ines is located in Carmo de Minas at 1100 meters, and this lot is 100% Yellow Bourbon cultivar. Yellow Bourbon is a sub-type that has fruit which ripens to a yellow color. It originated in Brazil. It is possible that Yellow Bourbon is a natural mutation of a cross between Bourbon and a yellow-fruited Typica called \"Amarelo de Botocatu\". Bourbon coffees are named for the island in the India Ocean where French colonists grew it. It's not so different in the cup than Red Bourbon, but I have noticed higher sugar levels in the Yellow fruit, and the plant has different physical properties.   \n",

It is located in Carmo de Minas in the Mantiqueira Mountain area and is a farm we've purchased coffee from for several years now. The photo on the landing page is a shot from above the farm, you can see the rows of coffee planted in the valley below the mountain range, as well as in the foothills. This 235 hectare farm is situated at 1250 meters, and has a mix of varietals including Bourbon, Acaia, and Icatu. This lot is a Red Bourbon separation from their farm, and Dry Process method. Dry process coffees are often casually referred to as \"naturals\", and only involves laying whole cherry to dry on cement patios. It can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks to dry the entire cherry and seed to stable levels (roughly 11% moisture), during which a fermentation occurs within the cherries. Sometimes this leads to fruity flavors, though not the case with this lot from Sertao. This coffee has what I think of as classic Brazilian cup characteristics that are body, low acidity, chocolate, and nut. It's a good coffee for espresso, or to use in a blend. Dry process coffees produce more chaff than a wet process, and you're going to want to vacuum out your roaster between batches.   \n",

We have not visited his farm yet, but his coffee was brought to us by a group who have helped with some of our Brazilian sourcing, and hope to get there this year. His coffee stood out as having interesting herbal accents that imparted a sort of \"floral\" hint in the cup, along with rustic flavors of a good dry process Brazilian coffee. It certainly grabbed our attention! Altitude in the growing region surrounding Santo Antônio do Amparo tops out around 1000 meters, and you see a lot of Bourbon, Catuaí, and Mundo Novo growing. This is a dry process lot from the farm, one of the oldest methods of processing coffee down to the green seed. In contrast to the wet process method, or even pulp natural, which is the other common way of processing coffee in Brazil, dry processing involves leaving the coffee cherry intact during the entire drying phase, until the green seed within reaches roughly 11% moisture. This can take upwards of 4 weeks time, depending on the weather.   \n",

The farm has stood much longer than the Junqueira family has owned it, dating back to the mid 1800's when the first coffee was planted and the original farm house was built. The farm is located just outside of Santa Rita do Sacupaí in the Mantiqueira Region of Minas Gerais. The land at São José is actually 508 hectares, much of which is still natural forest. It requires a fairly large team to manage just the part planted in coffee, and there are 22 permanent employees year round, as well as 100 seasonal workers who join for the harvest. The farm enjoys a modest altitude of 1200 meters above sea level, and is currently planted in Mundo Novo, Acaiá, Catuaí Amarelo, Catuaí Vermelho, Arara, and Catucaí. While much of Brazil coffee farmers have turned to harvesting machinery, the Junqueira family recognizes the importance of selecting ripe cherries in order to produce top grades, and has therefore chosen to stick with selective harvesting by hand. This lot is a pulp natural process which is about as closed to a fully washed coffee as you will get in Brazil, and quite similar to a mild honey process method in Costa Rica. The coffee cherry and much of the fruit are removed with depulping machinery, and then the seed is laid to dry with fruit mucilage still intact. Pulp naturals often possess more balanced flavors than dry process coffee, less fruited, and can still be big-bodied and lower acid coffees, making them a great choice for espresso and blending.   \n",

We chose the coffees specifically for decaffeination, based on the cup profiles having some mild fruit characteristics and pronounced acidity. In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate (\"EA\"). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname \"sugar cane decaf\", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want - including those that went into this decaf. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters, and each contributing lot in this batch are wet process coffees.   \n",

This is technically Cauca, but only a stones throw from the border with Huila. \"Chorrera\" is the Spanish word for stream. And while I shouldn't be surprised that when I asked folks in San Vicente what they call the small cascading waterfall and stream that cuts through town, they sort of shrugged their shoulders and said, \"La Chorrera\", I expected something a little less on the nose! This particular lot comprises coffee from 10 different farmers in San Vicente and the surrounding towns. We hiked to farms just above 2000 meters in San Vicente, and you could still see coffee growing higher on the surrounding ridge that was at least 100 meters higher. You see a lot of the typical varieties growing, Colombia, and Caturra, with smaller amounts of Typica, Bourbon, and Castillo. Farmers typically process their coffee on small depulping machines used to remove the outer cherry, and either hand-cranked, or run with small gas motors. The coffee is also dried in parabolic drying rooms, which are essentially outdoor structures that consist of a wooden frame and tarpaulin walls/roof with some kind of venting for airflow. They are typically built on a cement slab that the coffee dries on, or raised beds are erected inside.   \n",

As you make the drive from La Plata to Inzá, you follow the Rio Paez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the the villages whose coffees make up this blend. Like much of Colombia, Cauca is home to some very high altitude farms, many breaching the 2000 meter mark. This particular lot is a blend of coffees from a few of the neighboring Veredas within the region, altitudes ranging from 1500 - 2000+ meters. There's a very small amount from nearby Páez town, as well. The way we make up these regional blends is by cupping several samples from the individual farms, separating out those that meet a certain cup criteria, and then blending them together. It's a great benefit to us (and not to mention the cup) having this level of quality control with our Colombian blends. Wet processing is traditional in the region, many using old-style hand cranked pulpers, fermenting and washing in the same tank and then drying out on raised, covered beds. This last part is key in facilitating even and gentle drying of the parchment, helping to keep the protective parchment layer intact as the internal moisture dips to around 11 - 12% over the course of a few days to 2 weeks (depending on the micro-climate). Most farms have a healthy amount of Caturra planted, as well as some Timor hybrids (like Variedad Colombia and Tabi) that were heavily promoted for disease resistance.   \n",

Their ability to cross-breed is also an important distinction and can lead to new, and unique characteristics. Apples are a great example of this. Granny Smith, Red Delicious, Pink Lady, Honey Crisp, Empire, etc are all apples, but with genetic differences that are expressed in how they look and taste. But this set is about coffee varieties, not apples!   \n",

An outgrowth of the Association of Agricultural Producers Emprendimientos, this women's group has been operating since 2022 under the leadership of a woman named Bety Toro Lozno. The alliance aims to bridge market access directly to female farmers in Chirinos, and has grown to more than 200 members in its first two years. The farms range in altitude from 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level. Most farmers are growing a mix of cultivars, which typically include some combination of Caturra, Bourbon, Typica, Pache, and Catimor. Farmers have been trained to pick and process the varieties separately as a quality control measure, and this lot is a mix of Pache (natural mutation of Typica), and Catimor. This is a fully washed, \"wet process\" coffee, meaning the cherries are depulped, and the seeds are then fermented and washed in water to remove the sticky layer of mucilage. The coffee is dried on patios for up to 2 weeks in order to get the moisture down to roughly 11% before performing the final preparation for export.   \n",

The coffee is planted across an altitude range of 1500 to 1900 meters above sea level, and you see a broad selection of coffee cultivars including Caturra, Typica, Bourbon, Pache, Catuaí, and Catimor. The intermediary they work with have set up a program to incentivize farmers to replant their Catimor with other disease resistant hybrids that offer higher cup quality. I don't know that this is intentional, but in a way, having the disease-resistant hybrids in the mix helps hedge their risk against issues of coffee leaf rust and other coffee plant diseases that can spread throughout a crop if not treated right away. Most farmers use water-conserving mechanical demucilagers to process their coffee, leaving behind as much of the fruit as possible so that the moisture within will promote a fermentation without having the use water. They employ a variety of drying methods including polypropylene tents, cement patios, and raised beds, and the coffee is then dried until it reaches a safe moisture range of 9 - 11% before bagging up to rest.   \n",

Altitude in this area spans 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level, and the hilly peaks, and converging microclimates tend to be well suited for coffee production. There are a number of young and forward thinking producers in this area who are working to employ sustainable crop management through the use of both organic and synthetic fertilizers to replenish micro-organisms in the soil and enhance productivity and general plant health. This coffee is a blend of dry process lots from the group, and is a typical method of production. Farmers are drying whole cherries for up to 30 days, then storing the dried coffee in polyethylene bags for freshness, before eventually being moved to the dry mill for final sorting. The dry process method is known to imparting big fruit flavors, body, and milder acidity in the cup. I can honestly say that all of these aspects ring true here!   \n",

Edilberto's  farm sits at 1650 meters above sea level, and he has chosen to plant his farm in Caturra and Catuaí, rather than opt for disease-resistant hybrids. He manages the production at his small farm closely, along with his family, and the four pickers he hires during the harvest season. Most of his harvest is wet processed. However, this 25 bag lot is a dry process coffee, where the coffee is dried with the cherry still intact on patios in the sun. The time it takes to dry the seeds inside down to 10-11% moisture is 3-4 weeks, roughly three times the time it takes to dry a fully washed coffee. While not promised, this process method can impart fruity flavors in the cup, and big body, which is what we tasted in Edilberto's coffee.   \n",

The village is roughly 5 hours from Jaen, tucked away in the highlands of San Jose de Lourdes. She, and her husband Roger Chilcon, manage 3 hectares of land in El Diamante, on which they've planted a mix of Bourbon, and Caturra. Though not the only farmer to do this, Luz bags up the coffee cherry from the day's harvest and seals them up for about 24 hours before processing. The idea is to start fermentation within the cherry in the hopes of translating to a more complex cup (often realized as an increase in fruited notes). She and her husband also employ a somewhat long fermentation times (36 hours) which can have a similar affect on flavor profile. Once dry, the coffee is stored in polyethylene sacks that remain covered until transport in order to help preserve the quality. The coffee is still in it's outer parchment layer too, which also helps with freshness, and won't be removed until ready for export. Their farm sits between 1850 and 1900 meters above sea level.   \n",

Altitude range in SF is 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level and cultivars grown are typically Caturra, with some Typica and Bourbon mixed in. Farmers in Perlamayo typically have less than half a hectare of coffee planted, which is much less than what you see in the other towns we've bought coffee from (San Francisco, Alto Pirias, etc). This is a fully washed coffee, wet processed by the farmers who then deliver their coffee in dry parchment (the green bean with the thin parchment layer still intact) to a warehouse in Cajamarca where it is graded and purchased. The group who set up this buying operation are working to register all the farmers they buy from in order to help isolate different quality tiers, but also be able to issue the initial payments and any quality premiums themselves, something that was lacking when they were buying through more traditional avenues. It doesn't help that the roads leading to Huabal and within the district are much more rustic than some of their neighbors, limiting access to farmers in this region.   \n",

His 4 hectare coffee farm is planted with mostly Caturra, but you see patches of Bourbon, Typica and Castillo varieties mixed in. Marcial floats his coffee cherry before processing in order to remove the \"floaters\" - under ripe coffee that floats to the top of the water. This is a fully washed coffee, meaning that after most of the fruit is removed from the seed, the remaining sticky layer of mucilage is broken down by fermentation, in this case without water and for around 24 hours. He's built an indoor drying room to protect the coffee from the outside elements while it is drying.   \n",

This high altitude zone is home to many coffee producers, with farms reaching as high as 1900 meters. This blend is made up of the a hand full of coffee farmers in El Diamante, some of whom we've also purchased individual lots from (like Roger Chilcon). Most are growing a mix of cultivars, like Caturra, Bourbon, Typica and some Catimor. Coffee is processed at home using small depulping machines to remove the outer cherry before fermenting in tanks for around a day and a half. They then wash away the remaining fruit and move the coffee to indoor drying rooms made of wood frames and tarpaulin. I found this coffee really easy to roast in that it presented a nice, even coloring during the roasting process, and with well balanced flavors at both ends of our recommended roast range.   \n",

So it stands to reason that blending all Central American coffees would only enhance those aspects even more, right? After tasting this trio all blended together, the answer is a resounding \"yes\". \"Altiplano\" is the word we are using for high plains, not to be confused with THE Altiplano in South America. From the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica, to the Los Cuchumatanes in Guatemala, to the Los Arados mountains in Nicaragua, we bring in a wide variety of coffees with unique cup profile, and that all work extremely well as espresso. Blended together, the resulting cup or espresso has balance, and with an acidity that is controlled by roast development. This blend was built with espresso in mind, and includes all wet-process coffees that offer balanced flavors, body, and at least one has moderate acidity too. Roasting to City+ will have the highest tones in the cup, though we prefer at least Full City in our espresso machine. Full City/Full City+ will produce a more \"classic\" espresso profile with chocolate roast pungency, deep sweetness, and a fruited acidity that to me has an orange zest-like quality (though the cup is far from \"fruity\"). Altiplano is seasonal blend, and we'll be rotating new coffees in as they become available, updating the review when necessary.   \n",

Working under the codename of the \"Donkey Blend\" (don't ask how all these ridiculous names started ---I think it was George's fault) we came up with this. It is intended to be used several ways. As an all-decaf espresso blend I wanted it to work well under a wide variety of roasting conditions, in terms of both lighter Northern Italian type espresso roasts (the equivalent of a Full City to Vienna Roast) and the darker Southern Italian type roast (roasted to a French roast). I also wanted a good espresso from both air and drum roasters, and I wanted good crema. This is a lot to ask from a decaf, but I think this blend works very well. While origin tastes are muted in decafs, I think the bittersweet roast tastes from this blend are very good. My second focus was having the blend not have too much character so that it can be used as a base blend for a \"low-caf\" espresso. This means it should work well as 50-75% of your blend where you add other caffeinated coffees to give more aromatics and flavor: my choice would be a Ethiopian Harar, or a Central American (see our Blending Basics article for more). Why do we call this Donkey Blend? Frankly, I can't remember .. it just is...   \n",

This is a sweet but punchy little cup, and roasted fairly light it is a shock to the palette, but has great body and a smooth, sweet, stunning aftertaste. The joke behind the name: I imagine a fancy roaster charming a client in the cupping room, effusing about their \"Master Roaster\" and \"Master Blender\" and \"Master Cupper\", all in the trade for decades of course. Then I imagine the scene in their warehouse where hired apes rip open bags of green coffee and randomly hurl handfulls into the hopper for roasting. In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of \"espresso\" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today! Espresso Monkey has become our signature blend for some reason or other, perhaps because it is a true standard that we have sought to maintain for so long, and that we put such nice coffees into it.   \n",

For those who appreciate both, it's a match made in heaven, and I think you'll find the dark-toned fruits to be quite complimentary to the moderate level of cocoa roast flavors that comes with Full City to Full City+ roasts. The current blend (August 2023) is 1/3 wet process Ethiopia, which brought a slight floral aroma to the chocolatey low tones and fruits that find equal footing. That said, the wet process ingredient was chosen based on body and sweetness more than anything else. Full City is a good starting point, or roughly 30F post 1st Crack if your roaster has a thermocouple. You also achieve a fairly uniform roast coloring at this roast level, but being all dry process coffees, you should still expect some variation. Full City+ roasts will tone down the fruit quite a bit, and is where I think this Ethiopian blend works for milk drinks. But at Full City, the fruits are a little too wild for a cappuccino or latte in my opinion.   \n",

This decaf/regular coffee blend is much closer to \"one-third caff\", but that doesn't have the same ring to it! We've toyed around with having a half-caffeine blend, but just weren't sure there were others like us who crave a low-caffeine coffee at occasion where caffeine could be disruptive. This is a mix of 1 part single station coffee from Rwanda, with 2 parts decaffeinated coffees that were processed by Swiss Water Decaf. The result is a bittersweet brew that tastes 100% \"coffee\", without the side effects caused by the caffeine.   \n",

I wanted it also to be complex and hint at all of those tastes, and more. Here's the product of a lot of overly-caffeinated days of experimentation: the Liquid Amber Espresso Blend. It is named for the rich color and multitude of crema it produces. The blend was fairly complex to come up with ... after I found the general tastes I wanted, emerging from aroma and first sip through the very long aftertaste (if I don't cleanse my palate with water I will taste this coffee for a very......long.....time) I needed to play with the exact percentages. The specific blend, hey ... it is my secret! But I will tell you that the 5 coffees that really worked toward the flavor goal I imagined ended up surprising even me! We've refined the recipe over the year, and at the moment, there's a washed Central, wet-hulled Indonesia, a monsooned coffee, and even a modicum of quality Robusta. And to keep this a mystery, the blend contains some coffees not on our list. I admit this is a pretty wacky blend by the current fashion in espresso toward lighter-roasted and acidic coffees; it's downright dated really. But it works in its own way. Some emphasis here is on the physical character of the espresso, hence the use of the monsooned coffee, which has properties in terms of crema that no other coffee possesses. Even in cupping the dynamics of the foam/bubbles are clearly different from other coffees due to the changes in the bean from the monsoon processing technique.   \n",

The components are all dry-processed coffees from Yemen, Ethiopia and small amount of Brazilian coffee. Between these three, we find an espresso on the rustic and exotic side, some fruit-forward character and earth-toned bittersweetness in full effect. It's great as espresso in the Full City+ to Vienna roast territory, and the mix of dry process coffees handle well in the roaster, regardless of the difference in density when sticking to the recommended roast range. Full City roasts may show some variance, and I recommend taking your roasts closer to Full City+ development which will help afford roast evenness. Slowly ramping up the heat will also help in this effort if your roaster has manual heat control. For those without (like a popper for example), try slowing your roast by slightly overloading the chamber and I wouldn't stop the roast development until you're on the heels of 2nd snaps. (I \"overload\" the roast chamber by first turning the popper on, then adding coffee until just after it stops moving - it should only take a few seconds to get the coffee moving again). A balance of sweet and bittersweet flavors are achieved with rustic layers woven in both fruited and earthy. Moka Kadir has incredibly velvety body too that works very well in milk drinks.   \n",
       "120                                             Once there was \"Classic Italian,\" our espresso blend to set the benchmark for traditional European-style espresso. It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our \"dumping ground\" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! Oh, and No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!). New Classic generally involves Brazil as one of the base ingredients, with washed Centrals and South American coffees bolstering sweetness, and of course, chocolate roast tone. Blend ingredients will change with what's in season, but we always shoot for flavor continuity.   \n",

Maria Elena's farm, Finca La Salaca, sits at 1750 meters above sea level on the lush mountainous slopes of Zarcero in Costa Rica's famed West Valley growing region. The Pacific is the major influence in the West Valley with sprawling views of Naranjo and Alajuela readily available across it. Finca Salaca is planted with a lot of Villalobos varietal, some Villa Sarchi, and Caturra mixed in. This is a separation of Villa Sarchi, which is a natural mutation of Bourbon known for shorter stature (\"dwarf\"), high yield, and great cup potential - especially when grown at high altitudes. The Monte Brisas mill is incredibly clean and well cared for, and feels a bit like a museum with all of its meticulously maintained older machinery! The coffee is mechanically washed on a Desacafe machine and sun dried on raised beds adjacent to the wet mill. Leaving that fruit mucilage intact instead of washing it away is the hallmark of honey process coffee. This lot, however, is what some call \"semi-washed\", or \"white honey\", which is the Costa Rican equivalent of a fully washed coffee. The demucilager machine is calibrated to remove as much fruit as possible. Then the coffee is soaked for a short period to help wash away some of the remaining fruit. Without fermentation, there is still a very thin layer of fruit intact. This means the coffee looks a little darker when roasting it, and a much higher instance of chaff than the typical fully washed/fermented coffee.   \n",

Chinga Factory was the second mill to be developed under Othaya umbrella in 1960. \"Factories\" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular \"society\" in Kenya, what we would call a \"cooperative\". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya, and have had the good fortune to buy a few stellar lots the past two years. We bought three lots from the Chinga station this year alone including this AB lot, one each Peaberry and AA. This coffee's sweetness just blew us away, marked by some lovely fruit hints, and vibrant, bright acidity too. It was purchased direct, not through the Kenya auction system, so we could avoid the risk of losing it. To do this we pay a price that is higher than what the top auction bid might be, but it means we get the exact lot we want.   \n",

Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste!

This is a sweet but punchy little cup, and roasted fairly light it is a shock to the palette, but has great body and a smooth, sweet, stunning aftertaste. The joke behind the name: I imagine a fancy roaster charming a client in the cupping room, effusing about their \"Master Roaster\" and \"Master Blender\" and \"Master Cupper\", all in the trade for decades of course. Then I imagine the scene in their warehouse where hired apes rip open bags of green coffee and randomly hurl handfulls into the hopper for roasting. In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of \"espresso\" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today! Espresso Monkey has become our signature blend for some reason or other, perhaps because it is a true standard that we have sought to maintain for so long, and that we put such nice coffees into it.   \n",
